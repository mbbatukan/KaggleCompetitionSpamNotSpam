3824,"Subject: Home Pages for Computer Scientists
","I was doing a search on some research papers on computer science and
 ran across one of the most useful examples of public vertical search portals.
 http://hpsearch.uni-trier.de/hp/
 
 It's the home pages of 62,179 computer scientists.
 Mostly broken, but 50/50 on better title hits than DBLP.
 
 One thing that's interesting is that for Google's
 ""Similar Pages"", only one homepage which returns the FoRK Archive is
 the page below[1] Is he on FoRK.  Other similar pages
 include printer toner, home mortgages, and one for the origins of the
 prime radiant[2] which I found out is an Asmiov concept.
 
 The concept of a prime radiant is that there
 is a single interconnected FoRKlist that ties a large number of
 decentralized individuals throughout the world who's collective
 wisdom is a good model for predicint the future.

 Well, the 7.3 binary should work as long as you install the ""rpm404"" (IIRC)
 compatibility library. The only problem I have with some rpm 4.1 versions
 is that it sometimes hangs at the and of operations (-e, -i, -F or -U) and
 the only workaround is to kill it, ""rm -f /var/lib/rpm/__*"" and try again.

 Just ignore the laws completely. You cannot win the legal way, because the
 geek is a minority, and even not a lobby-toting minority at that. You
 Cannot Win That Way. Really.
 
 We need an uncensorable, hardened P2P infrastructure to distribute such
 staples as open source software.  Software patents are tragedy of the
 commons all over again. The collateral damage done by pirating is a
 complete footnote in comparison to the radioactive glass iron-fisted IP
 rights enforcement habitually produces.

2507,"Subject: [ILUG] 3c509 & 2.4.19 problems
","Hi folks,
 
 I decided to upgrade the kernel on a machine at home from 2.2.18pre21 to the latest from kernel.org which is 2.4.19.
 
 However I have encountered one problem, my network card now dosent work, well kind of dosent work...
 
 Instead of one eth0 on IRQ 10 I now get:
 Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x220, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a 3e 0e 48, IRQ 5.
 Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: 3c509.c:1.18 12Mar2001 becker@scyld.com
 Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html
 Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: eth1: 3c5x9 at 0x300, 10baseT port, address  00 10 5a be 0e 48, IRQ 10.
 Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: 3c509.c:1.18 12Mar2001 becker@scyld.com
 Aug  4 11:31:51 mira kernel: http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html
 
 This results in the interface(s) coming up but while packets can go out they can not come in.
 
 I've tried not loading the 3c509 mdule on bootup and then `modload 3c509 IRQ=10` bit it still gets loaded as above, on IRQ 5 and 10. On 2.2 it loads to IRQ 10.
 
 Anyone got any suggestions on what to do here? Its a debian 3.0 distro. This works fine when booted to 2.2 so the hardware/BIOS etc seem ok, so it seems to be 2.4 spacific. Have I missed some kernel setting?
 
 Cheers,
 ~Al

 AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks
 
 If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of
 the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain
 New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
 
 According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, ""the No.
 1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on
 [New York's] Upper East Side.
 
 ""It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store""
 on Madison Avenue, which features ""rich vulnerable women,"" the mag's
 October issue says.
 
 AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting
 place published, or being cited as the ""in"" place for finding loaded women
 - or rather, women who are loaded.
 
 ""The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and
 help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!"" an AA
 spokesman told The Post.

 Check the procmail documentation.  They actually recommend:

 That doesn't matter.  What does matter
 is that they were going on phenotypes,
 and didn't engineer the genetics.  That
 example makes a good case for natural
 selection, but not for artificial.
 
 (do ""married people live longer"" because
 of the benefits of matrimony, or because
 acceptable health is one of the qualities
 selected for in spouses?)
 
 Of course, if there are FoRKs with six
 or fewer biological great grandparents
 (or who are offspring of Wilt) I should
 eat my words; otherwise, the micro/macro
 distinction seems much more relevant.

 One can also view that argument as a case
 for checks: livestock owners have, over a
 period of millenia, altered the genetics
 of their herds to be dumber, meatier, and
 more tolerant of industrial living, so if
 caution is in order, they are some of the
 least likely people to volunteer it.

3314,"Subject: Never pay eBay listing fees again!
","Hi,
 
 I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
 I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
 $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?
 
 In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
 it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...
 
 You've probably heard stories about people making
 whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
 were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
 boy-geniuses.
 
 Well, grasshopper, think again ...
 
 It's people like you and me that are making the real
 money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!
 
 Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
 entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.
 
 Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
 like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
 financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
 work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
 technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.
 
 If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
 you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
 DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
 You might not want their product, but remember that 
 thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
 percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
 makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
 guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
 review some numbers ...
 
 If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
 dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
 auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
 couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
 over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
 SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
 at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
 ZERO!
 
 Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
 hardly anyone sees your ad!
 
 Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
 profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
 an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
 in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
 generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
 of work.  
 
 It's that simple ...
 
 All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
 THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.
 
 The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
 matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
 using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
 executive working from an office building in New 
 York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
 bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
 it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
 and some basic familiarity with the Internet.
 
 I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
 ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
 started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
 the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
 opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
 I bought my own home - with CASH.  
 
 You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
 You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
 whatsoever is required.  
 
 If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
 you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
 So what are you waiting for?!
 
 I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
 YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
 will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.
 
 Here goes ...
 
 Do you have basic experience with the web? 
 Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
 Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
 Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
 complete financial freedom?  
 
 If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
 making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
 home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
 the 9-5 daily grind!
 
 All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
 is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
 to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
 it.
 
 You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
 Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
 how to start your first email campaign and how to
 build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
 orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.
 
 Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?
 
 No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
 products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
 starting an Internet business because they have 
 nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
 After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
 product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
 not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
 seven days. In fact ...
 
 I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
 bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
 the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
 to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
 where else will you find that level of service?!
 
 I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
 your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
 Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
 routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
 instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
 example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
 The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
 list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
 very first campaign is ready to go.
 
 As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
 of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
 email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
 include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
 if you order NOW!
 
 Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
 classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
 never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
 on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
 What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
 to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
 you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
 extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 
 
 Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
 I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a

6152,"Subject: [Spambayes] Deployment
","Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
 think about deployment.
 
 Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
 spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
 about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
 as a filter.
 
 A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
 easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
 individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).
 
 There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:
 
 - A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You
   configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then
   point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it
   receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
   your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only
   need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that
   anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.
 
 - A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message
   and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"".  Then you have a little program
   that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The
   server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the
   scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle
   would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe
   marshalling.)
 
 - Your idea here.
 
 Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl
 Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

 I'm skeptical.  
 
 One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
 rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
 is more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
 history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
 Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
 Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
 know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
 People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
 substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
 facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
 that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
 Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
 in popular culture.
 
 I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
 you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
 have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
 population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.

 I dunno if I'd accuse everybody who believes the 3K number of needing a

 there's a lot of people who need more lovin.  Plus it fits in with a bunch

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85515860
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
 has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
 here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
 from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
 it up. 
 
 It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
 ""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
 time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
 segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 
 
 So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
 and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
 Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_
 Thanks, Rob!_)

 mh used them nicely.  mh stores one message per file.  the refile command
 allows you to move a message from one folder to another *or* link it to
 another folder.  it uses hard links to do this.  this would suck to if
 it used soft links - what if i later deleted the actual file?

372,"Subject: Red Hat 8.0
","Hi,
 
 Red Hat 8.0 is released tomorrow (monday).  I took some time out to make 
 RPMs of GStreamer for it.
 
 All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt 
 repository in a new ""redhat-80-i386"" directory.
 
 The repository for dependencies is again called ""deps"", and the one for 
 the gstreamer rpms is ""redhat"", because this time around the base distro 
 contains all the necessary packages.
 
 A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at
 http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png
 
 
 Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms :
 
 a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't 
 have a -devel package for it yet
 
 b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.
 Here are the errors:
 
 INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin 
 /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin 
 /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0: 
 undefined symbol: _ZTVN10__cxxabiv120__si_class_type_infoE
 
 Plugin /usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load
 DEBUG(15299: 0)gst_plugin_load_plugin:161: attempt to load plugin 
 ""/usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so""
 INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin 
 /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so failed to load: Error loading plugin 
 /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so, reason: /usr/lib/gst/libgstmodplug.so: 
 undefined symbol: __gxx_personality_v0
 
 I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib 
 reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must 
 be something straightforward that should fix this.
 If anyone has a suggestion, please share ;)

 This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
 in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
 Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
 currently :
 1. Leave your current kernel as-is
 2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
 3. Rebuild and install resulting packages
 
 Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
 NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
 as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.
 
 Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
 my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
 case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
 for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
 you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)
 
 Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
 in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
 systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
 other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
 use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
 without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

 PS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact
 since you can easily answer ""freshrpms.net!"" to people asking how to play
 DVDs, right? ;-))))

 Maybe you could find more info or tips on the ALSA page for your card?
 Also, you could try ""alsactl store"", editing /etc/asound.state"" by hand
 (for me it contains data similar to what I can control with ""alsamixer"")
 then run ""alsactl restore"" and see if you're able to change what you want
 that way.

 If you get this message, it means that you're using the ""DVD"" button, which
 is the default DVD plugin and doesn't support decryption. You should either
 use the ""d4d"" one (no menus) or ""d5d"" (with menus).

 Looking at http://www.sapdb.org/history.htm , it seems that SAP went
 open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
 at the time I compiled that list.
 
 In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
 source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
 all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
 attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
 proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
 proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
 a separate permission grant for it.

7459,"Subject: Whither vCard?
","Does anyone know what happened to vCard support in Netscape 7.0/Mozilla 
 1.1?
  (Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I 
 presume?)
 
 Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can't 
 find vCard or a reference to it anywhere.  I like the Netscape/Mozilla 
 email client.  I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only 
 (my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues.
 
 Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are 
 becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard?
 Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between 
 the two?
 
 I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along 
 with more PKI oriented focus.  Any wisdom would be appreciated.  In 
 particular, I'm going to start integrating smart cards into my linux and 
 Win32 systems and integrating them with Netscape Messenger/Mozilla and 
 Outlook.
 
 Thanks

 _Jeffrey Zeldman_: OS X Blues update[1]. 
 
     A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
     of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of 
     standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the 
     right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel 
     is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, 
     but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's 
     flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that 
     feeling of loss.

","802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
 (also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
 802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
 times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
 8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
 more reliable data transmission.
 Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
 video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
 comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
 interference or too many clients.
 Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
 area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
 want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
 directional antenna either way.
 
 Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
 802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
 be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.
 
 
 Give me bandwidth or give me death,
 Elias

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85490211
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan 
 Moore's _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Tom Strong_ (thanks, Zed) funnybook. 
 These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
 domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
 unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
 life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the 
 public domain. This was just Slashdotted, so it might be a little slow, but 
 it's worth the wait. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via /.[3]_)

 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">It would be much more useful to the industry, if SPFA would help find a ""CODE CONFORMING"" fire barrier for attics, crawl spaces etc., than&nbsp; lecture on Fast and Loose applications of code.&nbsp; Something about 30 cents (a BD. FT.) installed, meeting All codes and spray applied. Many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect BUT they haven't spent the money to test over foam. Maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products, report results to SPFA, who in turn will ""acquire funding"" from US.</P>

 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">I'm sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a ""thermal Barrier"". What the hell do you think foam is? If you are saying that anything that can be FORCED to burn should be covered with a FIREPROOF barrier, then you'd better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely NOT carrying a class one fire rating. This double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it. Icynene is DIFFERENT.&nbsp; IT DOESN'T BURN ALONE. IT DOESN'T MELT. IT DOESN'T EMIT PHOSGENE. Does it smoke in a fire situation? Sure, so what?</P>
 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt""><BR>Blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car. Get real, inspectors. You want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that DOESN'T BURN!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
 <P class=arial style=""MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"">As for the vaunted R rating system, IT IS TOTALLY BOGUS. The test is designed to make porous insulations APPEAR to perform better than they actually do.&nbsp; Measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer, the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago, along with that obsolete fiberglass<BR>garbage they're still selling everybody.&nbsp; There's a reason they don't make refrigerators, freezers coolers &amp; coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about it.</P>

   | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
   | Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up

   | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.
 
 I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,
 have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
 selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
 which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.
 
 The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
 where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
 when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
 of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
 application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
 normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
 selection (that is, set it to be a null string).
 
 Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
 find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
 point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
 PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
 else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
 either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
 deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.
 
 That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.
 
 Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
 ""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
 that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
 is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).
 
 kre
 
 ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
 really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
 part of the code and see how it all really operates.

 ""Carbon dioxide turned into hydrocarbon fuel 
 (((Please, no immediate lectures on the second law of 
 thermodynamics. I have plenty of those.)))
 
 ""16:0002August02
 
 ""A way to turn carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons has caused 
 a big stir at an industrial chemistry conference in New 
 Brunwick, New Jersey. Nakamichi Yamasaki of the Tokushima 
 Industrial Technology Center in Japan says he has a 
 process that makes propane and butane at relatively low 
 temperatures and pressures.""
 
 Link: Yes, he actually exists:

 http://www.itc.pref.tokushima.jp/English/eindex.html
 
 ""Making fuel from greenhouse gases
 
 ""While his work still needs independent verification,  
 (((okay, go fetch us some, then))) if he can make even 
 heavier hydrocarbons, it might be possible to make petrol. 
 It has carbon chains that are between five and 12 atoms 
 long == butane is four atoms long.  (((""That's right, 
 Professor: I just hook it up to the sky and I make 
 gasoline!"")))
 
    ""The work suggests the tantalising prospect that CO2, 
 the main greenhouse gas, could be recycled instead of 
 being pumped into the atmosphere.
 
     ""Many people have tried before to make hydrocarbons by 
 mixing carbon with hydrogen gas in a reaction chamber at 
 very high temperatures, but yields have always been 
 pitiful. Yamasaki has used hydrochloric acid as his source 
 of hydrogen ions. (((""But where are we s'posed to get all 
 that hydrochloric acid?"" Yes, I know, I know.)))
 
     ""He bubbles the CO2 into a reaction vessel where it is 
 heated to about 300 C at 100 times atmospheric pressure. 
 The heat and pressure are low enough, says Yamasaki, to 
 make it feasible to scale up the reaction so it can run on 
 a power station's waste heat. (((Imagine the fun when a 
 giant tank of pressurized acid blows up.)))
 
 ""Iron powder 
 
    ""Using iron powder as a catalyst, Yamasaki says he has 
 made substantial amounts of methane, ethane, propane and 
 butane, which he was able to vent off as gases when the 
 mixture cooled. If he can improve the catalyst's 
 performance he is hopeful of making heavier hydrocarbons 
 such as petrol, too. 
 
     ""William Siegfried, who has lead similar experiments 
 at the University of Minnesota in the twin cities of 
 Minneapolis and St Paul, says his group was only able to 
 make methane at far higher temperatures. But his process 
 also used a nickel-based alloy as a catalyst, rather than 
 iron.
 
     ""Siegfried's group was investigating whether natural 
 methane deposits might have formed chemically with the 
 metal in rocks acting as a catalyst rather than forming 
 from the decay of rotting biological material over aeons.  
 (((Paging Thomas Gold! ""Deep Hot Biosphere"" calling on 
 line one.)))
 
    ""Unless Yamasaki's technology can make the more 
 valuable heavier hydrocarbons such as petroleum, which are 
 liquid at room temperature, it will not be much more use 
 than present-day bioreactors, in which bacteria that like 
 to feed on CO2 are induced to produce methane. 'Organisms 
 have a special talent for that kind of reaction,' says 
 Siegfried.

 Unfortunately strlen is a relatively expensive operation. If you are using
 C++ this is not such a big issue as string.length() can be declared const.
 So long as you do not modify the string object, the compiler can do the
 caching for you.
 
 I do not think this is possible in C, though?
 
 You could write the same code fragment as:
 ============================
 for(a=0,l=strlen(somestring);a<l;a++)
 {
     some_thing_goes_here();
     if(b==l-4)
         do_something();
 }
 ============================
 
 Note my previous point: if some_thing_goes_here() or do_something() are very
 long functions, then there is no real need to optimise this code.
 
 Also, for string manipulation, a much better approach would be:
 ============================
 char c;
 char* p;
 for(p=somestring,(c=*p)!=0;p++)
 {
     some_thing_goes_here();
     if(*(p+4)==0)
         do_something();
 }
 ============================
 
 This works because C used \0 terminated strings. It improves performance
 because you always have a pointer to the character instead of having to do
 array manipulation. Strictly speaking, the variable c is not required as
 most compilers are smart enough to store *p in a register.
 
 The problem is that this uses pointer arithmetic, which can make the code
 illegable if not managed carefully. Which is one of the reasons I prefer
 Java for most programming tasks. :)

 So Eugen, how many of your homo friends have -had- 3k lovers?
 
 In fact, thats a general question for FoRK proper.
 
 Do you know anyone, outside of meybee Wilt Chamberlin and a few of the
 gang-bang porn queens who -have- had even 1.5k lovers?
 
 Eegads, if you're hypothesizing numbers like -that- Eugen, you at
 least owe it to FoRK to back that shit up.
 
 Otherwise we're liable to assume rampant unfounded homophobia and that
 would just be a lose.
 
 Just a quick assumption here.   I'm not a math geek or anything, but
 assuming 1 lover every day, that would be like at least one lover
 everyday for 8 years and some change.   I don't know about you, but
 very very few of us are -that- lucky (or even close to that lucky)
 and after awhile, even the sexaholics get bored and have to mingle
 something new into their weekends.   You really are assumiing that the
 homosexual population is a) that large in a given area (The meccas
 might qualify, but try finding that kind of homosexual population in
 say, Tulsa, Oklahoma or Manchester, NH (Tho Manchester does have quite
 a few nifty gaybars, but thats a different story)  b) that bored/sex
 obsessed/recreationally free to pursue sex that often, with that many
 partners or that they'd even WANT that many partners.
 
 Qualify yourself, or at least lower your outrageous numbers.

 All of these ""af6"" are related to avifile6 support :-/
 Normally, my 0.6.1-fr2 build of transcode defaults to *not* use avifile,
 but you can use ""--with avifile6"" to force recompiling against it.
 
 Do you have an old avifile installed maybe?
 Can you check the ""./configure ..."" line run at the beginning of the
 rebuild process to see if it does include the ""--without-avifile6"" option?

","Hello
 
 You may have seen this business before and
 ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
 please take a few moments to read this letter.
 I was amazed when the profit potential of this
 business finally sunk in... and it works!
 
 With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
 success in this business is now fast, easy and
 well within the capabilities of ordinary people
 who know little about internet marketing. And the
 earnings potential is truly staggering!
 
 I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
 follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
 worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
 President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
 Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
 to one of these before either. One day though,
 something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
 a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
 Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
 come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. 
 
 I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
 doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
 It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
 and selling something of value.
 
 AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
 
 Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
 months from your home.
 
 THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
 ==================================================
 BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
 Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
 This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
 news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
 the internet, a national weekly news program recently
 devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
 program described below, to see if it really can make
 people money. The show also investigated whether or
 not the program was legal.
 
 Their findings proved once and for all that there are
 ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
 the program and if people can 'follow the simple
 instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
 with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
 
 DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
 THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
 BETTER THAN EVER.
 
 This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
 profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
 before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
 I finally joined just to see what one could expect
 in return for the minimal effort and money required.
 To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""
 
 Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
 ==================================================
 Another said: ""This program has been around for a
 long time but I never believed in it. But one day
 when I received this again in the mail I decided
 to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
 instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
 money started to come in. First month I only made
 $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
 a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
 by re-entering the program, I have made over
 $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
 success in this program is to follow the simple
 steps and NOT change anything.""

 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
 FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
 YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
 
 INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
 For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
 REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
 person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
 MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
 LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
 ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
 ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
 You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
 them on your computer and resell them.
 YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
 
 Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
 of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
 Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
 for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
 order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
 reports and keep it on your desk in case something
 happens to your computer.
 
 IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
 are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
 the list, in any way other than what is instructed
 below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
 on the majority of your profits. Once you
 understand the way this works, you will also
 see how it will not work if you change it. 
 
 Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
 alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
 to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
 thinking they could get all the money. But it does
 not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
 be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
 try to change anything other than what is instructed.
 Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
 
 This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
 product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
 as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
 period of time.
 
 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
 advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
 person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
 the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
 
 2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
 
 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
 
 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
 
 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
 
 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
 
 PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
 ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.
 
 ==================================================
 **** Take this entire letter, with the modified
 list of names, and save it on your computer.
 DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
 Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
 any data. To assist you with marketing your business
 on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
 provide you with invaluable marketing information
 which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
 where to find thousands of free classified ads and
 much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
 venture going:
 
 METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
 ==================================================
 
 Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
 how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
 send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
 that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
 response (the response could be much better but let's
 just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
 out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
 5,000 each.
 
 Continuing with this example, you send out only
 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
 by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
 responded with orders. That's 100 people who
 responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
 Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
 a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
 that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
 Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
 total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
 response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
 Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
 for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
 The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
 Report # 5.
 
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
 (half a million dollars).
 
 Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
 FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
 MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
 MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
 ==================================================
 
 REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
 ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
 for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
 or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
 e-mails each or more?
 
 There are over 150 million people on the internet
 worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
 online every day. Believe me, many people will do
 just that, and more!
 
 METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
 ==================================================
 
 Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
 there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
 Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
 easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
 you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
 go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
 do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
 Always provide same day service on all orders.
 
 This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
 with your name and address on it, will be prompt
 because they cannot advertise until they receive
 the report.
 
 ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
 The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
 illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
 Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
 approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
 can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
 it before it gets to you.
 
 ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
 Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
 each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
 cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
 paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
 you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
 name and postal address.

 $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
 
 Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
 === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
 Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
 until you do.
 
 === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
 after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
 REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
 sending e-mails until you do.
 
 ** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
 Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
 already working for you, and the cash will continue
 to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
 your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
 in front of a different report.
 
 You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
 report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
 GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
 AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
 to the income you can generate from this business !!!
 =================================================
 FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
 You have just received information that can give you
 financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
 NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
 make more money in the next few weeks and months
 than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
 EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
 It works exceedingly well as it is now.
 
 Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
 after you have put your name and address in
 Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
 instructed above. One of the people you send this
 to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
 name will be on every one of them. 
 
 Remember though, the more you send out the more
 potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
 I have given you the ideas, information, materials
 and opportunity to become financially independent.
 
 IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
 
 =============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
 ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
 Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
 Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
 received this program I grumbled to Jody about
 receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
 thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
 and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
 Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
 few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
 merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. 
 
 Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
 received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
 had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
 I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""
 
 Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
 ================================================
 ""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
 weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
 But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
 investment was so little that there was just no way
 that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
 my money back. I was surprised when I found my
 medium size post office box crammed with orders.
 I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. 
 
 The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
 matter where people live. There simply isn't a
 better investment with a faster return and so big.""
 
 Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
 =================================================
 ""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
 but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
 Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
 another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
 again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
 it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
 I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
 money came within 22 weeks.""
 
 Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
 =================================================
 ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
 easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
 simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
 money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
 in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
 third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
 Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

 Dear Sir.
 
 First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.
 
 I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.
 
 We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 
 
 If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.
 
 Yours faithfully,
 
 DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

 <b>Microsoft reveals media XP details</b><br>
 <font size=""-1"">
 Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
 Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.

 Hewlett-Packard has shuffled employees out of its Jornada Pocket PC development unit in Singapore, as the company continues to cut costs following its merger with Compaq Computer.
 Jornada products are developed in Singapore and will be phased out by year's end, with the exception of Jornada 720, which resembles a mini-notebook. The model will eventually be rebranded as an HP iPaq device.

 Last week my hands and shoulders were starting to really act up on me again. 
 The pain. I will spare you the details of my emotions when work all day with 
 pain and discomfort in what feels like my whole body. Tuesday I dragged myself 
 to yoga class at the Iyengar Yoga Institute of Los Angeles. Actually, that's 
 not quite true. Viridiana dragged me there. Look how messed up that is. I only 
 go when I'm in pain, and...

 That's what I've been told by everyone I've talked to who's actually
 tried to write one.

 I think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham.  I
 like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
 sequestered for some period of time before they're assumed to be ham.
 Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
 training up to date with little effort.  I've sketched out an approach
 a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
 free time I'll hack something together.
 
 I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
 they're pulled from the server.  The easiest way for such a beast to
 be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
 folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.

 1. Feedback, notes and comments
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 MACHINIMA  My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am
 keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's
 piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all
 places, I misspelled it ""mechanima"", thus confusing everybody.
 
 APPETITE OVER TIN CUP  Several replies came in about this saying,
 confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying ""head
 over heels"" are widely known, especially ""ass over appetite"" from
 the US, where ""appetite"" may be a transferred term for the mouth.
 But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,
 ""appetite over tin cup"", seems not to be known much at all. It
 would seem to be a conflation of the British expression ""arse over
 teakettle"" and the American ""ass over appetite"" (note my deliberate
 use of the two spellings of ""arse"" here!). The saying was probably
 modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an
 item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these
 days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,
 which itself is now not very common.
 
 BUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is
 in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film ""Chitty
 Chitty Bang Bang"":
 
   Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
   You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
   You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
   But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
 
 It may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word
 in their own country, have come to believe it must be British.
 
 OLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved
 back a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is
 scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the
 date again). See <http://www.worldwidewords.org/ologies.htm> for
 more details and UK ordering information.
 
 
 2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what
 with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El Nio season,
 UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's
 climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping
 the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,
 carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from
 burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%
 of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,
 leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme
 weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed
 rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just
 Asia. The term ""Asian Brown Cloud"" seems to have been around for a
 couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this
 week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists
 at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit
 on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good
 news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and
 climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more
 efficient ways of burning fuels.
 
 The ""Asian Brown Cloud,"" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
 South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
 people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and
 drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.
                                    [""Los Angeles Times"", Aug. 2002]
 
 A UN-backed study released on Friday said the ""Asian Brown Cloud"" -
 a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging
 agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the
 population.

 3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /'pIknIk/
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Short and fat.
 
 Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way
 as ""picnic"".
 
 In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist
 Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical
 shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.
 Tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and
 considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.
 A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom
 he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The
 third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of
 the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were
 concerned. He took ""pyknic"" from Greek ""puknos"", thick or close-
 packed; it appeared first in his book ""Krperbau und Charakter""
 (Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into
 English.
 
 The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified
 Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body
 types - ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph"" - that are now
 more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture
 of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the
 Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and
 athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came
 up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who
 is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and
 balloons out into obesity.
 
 
 4. Q&A
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the ""New York
 Times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". I had never heard this
 term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.
 Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can
 you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane
 Rosenthal, California]
 
 A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase.
 
 We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was
 the word ""mash"" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the
 1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as
 ""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). A ""mash"" could also
 be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as
 a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,
 to flirt or seduce. A ""masher"" was a man who thought himself
 irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often
 unwelcome.
 
 The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the ""Random House
 Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" and by others suggests
 that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.
 Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his ""Hans Breitmanns
 Ballads"" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,
 ""The Masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this:
 
   The word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or
   attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into
   ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress
   was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the
   audience.
 
 ""Mash"" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about
 1880. ""Masher"" in particular became a term in London society,
 especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going
 classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English
 Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing
 away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and
 exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and
 fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'"", noting
 that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"".
 In a letter from London in the old ""Overland Monthly and Out West
 Magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an
 impoverished theatrical company: ""This dashing youth was distinctly
 conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside
 us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that
 superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a
 far higher class"".
 
 A ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an
 obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in
 1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.
 
 Where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of
 debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English
 word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious
 reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and
 yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were
 still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some
 people derived it from ""Ma Chre"", ""the mode of address used by the
 gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". But he thought it
 really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a
 great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing
 Montmorency of the day.'"" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,
 but he could hardly know that.
 
 Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he
 also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as
 well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the
 introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely
 accepted:
 
   It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,
   C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word
   ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude,
   or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by
   its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be
   no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the
   stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-

 Be amazed - I've never bought anything online since an almighty cock up

 all the dosh I'd paid them and had no books to show for it either. Had
 it been the UK branch I'd have had them in the small claims court
 quicker than you could drop LOTR on your foot and say ""ouch"", but as it

     From:        Brent Welch <welch@panasas.com>
     Message-ID:  <200209230521.BAA11218@blackcomb.panasas.com>
 
   | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
   | Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
   | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
   | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
   | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.
 
 I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,
 have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
 selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
 which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.
 
 The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
 where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
 when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
 of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
 application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
 normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
 selection (that is, set it to be a null string).
 
 Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
 find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
 point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
 PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
 else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
 either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
 deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.
 
 That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.
 
 Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
 ""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
 that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
 is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).
 
 kre
 
 ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
 really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
 part of the code and see how it all really operates.

 Are you kidding? It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what exposure that got
 them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly 
 exasperated Rumsfeld and their ""UN Inspections not war"" banner. That picture
 will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and 
 France, at least. For goodness sakes, you're arguing about it on FoRK. In 
 politics by sound-bite, those two rude hags kicked ass and took names.
 
 For the record, I don't think they even got arrested, which is a shame. It
 is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on the nightly
 news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.

 Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
 model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
 was how I read it. ;)
 
 I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
 across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
 it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
 displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.
 
 My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
 like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
 handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
 And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
 and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
 confusion is, frankly.

 Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
 included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
 wildcards when rotating files so something like
 /home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

 I also have received both the virus and email on how to get 
 rid of it.  Luckily I don't open ANY attachments, unless I'm 
 expecting them and then am still very careful.  
 
 Here's the ways I was told to get rid of the thing:
 
 One Fix Tool:
 
 Download fix_sircam.com and run the file. It will scan Drive
 C:\ and subfolders and runs in DOS.
 http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com
 
 Another Trojan Fix Tool
 http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com
 The fix tool will run from your desktop and will ""automatically"" 
 rid your computer from the SirCam Trojan and clean up an 
 entries from your registry files.
 
 After running either fix tool -- reboot your system.
 
 Hope this helps!

 Dear Nicety,
 
 As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking 
 up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution.  
 There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts 
 resulting in a locked machine.  One major problem is that many 
 programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working 
 in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a 
 regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened 
 and closed several different applications.
 
 Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,
 wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating
 system vs Windows NT.  You can read it at 
 http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/.  What was true back then is 
 even truer today.  Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about 
 on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems. 
 
  So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change 
 the OS.  Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of 
 weeks at a time with no need to reboot.  In over a year of running 
 I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over. 
 I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and 
 the price is right -- free.

 SITE  REVIEWED!
 
 Comments on Site #140:  http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding
 Margarete
 MDegaston@aol.com
 ~~~~
 
 I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate 
 sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well 
 presented.  In my opinion, the book site could have been 
 a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site, 
 preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a 
 relationship to it.
 
 What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something 
 related to the url  ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this 
 ""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to 
 click in the first place.
 
 I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and 
 not a preface to it.  The main site should be the PW and the 
 book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.
 (You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)
 
 With these:
 
 Find out how you can receive the free book.
 Email us at directions4U@aol.com        
 and
 For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing 
 write to us at directions4U@aol.com
 
 I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than 
 copy and paste.
 
 Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them. 
 (and I have ordered the book!)
 ~~~~
 
 I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.  
 Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics 
 or where we were headed.
 ~~~~
 
 Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.
 
 Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish 
 between the links and that which is not.
 
 I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also 
 linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that 
 link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.
 
 If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a 
 request message to an aol email address you would get more 
 requests, and also might be able to automate this process.
 ~~~~
 
 I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.
 It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.  
 If only other sites we so simplistic!
 ~~~~
 
 With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact 
 on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences 
 in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box 
 with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of 
 'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended 
 to go from side to side. In the first paragraph  '... an amazing 100 
 year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead of 
 using the word 'text'.  Also it would add credibility to say where 
 or how or by whom it was discovered.
 
 The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that 
 would make the site more effective (on getting people to request 
 the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in 
 what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to 
 order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form 
 for this just about anywhere.

 <br>Subject:&nbsp; More on the SirCam virus
 <p>In Exchange Issue #440, JT wrote...
 <p>>It's called the SirCam virus, and when it spreads, it sends
 <br>>an apparently random file from the harddrives of infected
 <br>>computers along with it. ANY file on your machine could
 <br>>be copied and sent to hundreds of other users.
 <p>I also have received both the virus and email on how to get
 <br>rid of it.&nbsp; Luckily I don't open ANY attachments, unless I'm
 <br>expecting them and then am still very careful.
 <p>Here's the ways I was told to get rid of the thing:
 <p>One Fix Tool:
 <p>Download fix_sircam.com and run the file. It will scan Drive
 <br>C:\ and subfolders and runs in DOS.
 <br><a href=""http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com"">http://www.antivirus.com/vinfo/security/fix_sircam.com</a>
 <p>Another Trojan Fix Tool
 <br><a href=""http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com"">http://www.sarc.com/avcenter/FixSirc.com</a>
 <br>The fix tool will run from your desktop and will ""automatically""
 <br>rid your computer from the SirCam Trojan and clean up an
 <br>entries from your registry files.
 <p>After running either fix tool -- reboot your system.
 <p>Hope this helps!

 <p>>From:&nbsp; NICETY7078@aol.com
 <br>>Subject:&nbsp; What can I do about my computer freezing? (Issue #439)
 <br>>
 <br>>My computer freezes when I use AOL and sometimes when
 <br>>I'm just using the basic functions of Windows 98. My
 <br>>defragmentor&nbsp; keeps starting over and over and my scan
 <br>>disk never finds anything wrong, but there has to be.
 <p>Dear Nicety,
 <p>As regards your problem with Windoze freezing and locking
 <br>up your computer I'm afraid your ""SOL"" as finding a true solution.
 <br>There are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts
 <br>resulting in a locked machine.&nbsp; One major problem is that many
 <br>programs don't release memory when you exit.&nbsp; When working
 <br>in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a
 <br>regular basis before I've had problems, especially if I've opened
 <br>and closed several different applications.
 <p>Back in August 1999 John Kirch, a Microsoft Certified Professional,
 <br>wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a *nix operating
 <br>system vs Windows NT.&nbsp; You can read it at
 <br><a href=""http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/"">http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/kirch/</a>.&nbsp;
 What was true back then is
 <br>even truer today.&nbsp; Every current ""worm"" you are hearing about
 <br>on the news lately occurs in Windoze operating systems.
 <p>&nbsp;So, IMHO, the solution to your machine locking-up is to change
 <br>the OS.&nbsp; Running Linux, my machine has been up for periods of
 <br>weeks at a time with no need to reboot.&nbsp; In over a year of running
 <br>I can count the lock-ups on one hand and have fingers left over.
 <br>I have more software installed than I ever had in Windoze ... and
 <br>the price is right -- free.

 <p>Comments on Site #140:&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding"">http://www.prosperouswomen.bizland.com/masterminding</a>
 <br>Margarete
 <br>MDegaston@aol.com
 <br>~~~~
 <p>I really love clean, uncluttered, easy to read and navigate
 <br>sites like these two. They are both very attractive and well
 <br>presented.&nbsp; In my opinion, the book site could have been
 <br>a little softer, or with similar characteristics to the next site,
 <br>preparing me for the site that it links to, and having a
 <br>relationship to it.
 <p>What I did feel most, was that I was expecting something
 <br>related to the url&nbsp; ""prosperouswomen"" to come up, as this
 <br>""word"" was what caught my attention and caused me to
 <br>click in the first place.
 <p>I feel the book page should be a tool for the ""PW"" page and
 <br>not a preface to it.&nbsp; The main site should be the PW and the
 <br>book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page.
 <br>(You need to take e out of changing on the book page.)
 <p>With these:
 <p>Find out how you can receive the free book.
 <br>Email us at directions4U@aol.com
 <br>and
 <br>For this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing
 <br>write to us at directions4U@aol.com
 <p>I would have liked these to be clickable links, rather than
 <br>copy and paste.
 <p>Very nice job on the sites, Margarete ... I really liked them.
 <br>(and I have ordered the book!)
 <br>~~~~
 <p>I waited over 70 seconds and had yet to see the first page.
 <br>Could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics
 <br>or where we were headed.
 <br>~~~~
 <p>Very clear, focused site with one page promoting a free book.
 <p>Don't underline text unless it's a link, or somehow distinguish
 <br>between the links and that which is not.
 <p>I finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also
 <br>linked so I checked that out also. I think you need to make that
 <br>link more noticeable, and also link to your bizland site.
 <p>If you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a
 <br>request message to an aol email address you would get more
 <br>requests, and also might be able to automate this process.
 <br>~~~~
 <p>I loved this site because it was clear, simple and to the point.
 <br>It also peaked my curiosity and I followed the link supplied.
 <br>If only other sites we so simplistic!
 <br>~~~~
 <p>With the masterminding site, the first sentence 'Major Impact
 <br>on Your Life' is incomplete. There were also run-on sentences
 <br>in the copy, even though the copy is quite effective. The box
 <br>with ""Life Changeing Insight"" needs the 'e' taken out of
 <br>'changeing', and it looked like the text could have been extended
 <br>to go from side to side. In the first paragraph&nbsp; '... an amazing
 100
 <br>year old text...' felt like it should be 'book' or 'secret' instead
 of
 <br>using the word 'text'.&nbsp; Also it would add credibility to say where
 <br>or how or by whom it was discovered.
 <p>The message is clear, the site design simple. Two things that
 <br>would make the site more effective (on getting people to request
 <br>the book) would be to say if this is an ebook, how long it is, in
 <br>what format it is, etc. and then also using a form for people to
 <br>order instead of emailing. You should be able to pick up a form
 <br>for this just about anywhere.

","what takes time and money: noting the amounts of each correction and basing
 the refund delivery method on the amount.  yesh, it's silly to spend $.37 (+
 labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right
 now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep
 the money (see john hall below).  your mailed refund is a function of bulk.
 
 in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service
 and over-charging.  what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per
 customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the

 lump sum settlement.
 
 in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like
 their lump sum to go.  of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first.

 They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
 insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
 $.02.
 
 Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
 alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
 to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
 could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
 starts adding up.

 Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing--I didn't realize I was incurring
 administrative pickle bloat this way.  I'm specifically trying to make
 things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles
 into an anydbm dict (keyed by token).  The result is that it's almost 50
 times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs
 18.851s).
 
 However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project
 isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess
 I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts
 to point more in that direction.  .4 seconds is probably fast enough for
 people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after.

 That's probably what I'll do if I get too antsy :)

5568,"Subject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?
","[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the 
 article I was commenting on... Rohit]
 
 In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The 
 Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most 
 subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which 
 merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By 
 maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web, 
 if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.
 
 The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce 
 these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from 
 Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all 
 Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 
 encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to 
 SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; 
 censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in 
 China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of 
 IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in 
 the article.
 
 Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic 
 costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free 
 flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
 sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest 
 of the Web?
 
 To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector 
 programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just 
 imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure 
 access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom 
 of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most 
 of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.
 
 On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* 
 the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...
 
 Best,
    Rohit Khare
 
 ===========================================================
 
 The search goes on
 China backtracks on banning Googleup to a point
 
 Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
  From The Economist print edition
 
 IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, 
 is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of 
 Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving 
 an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked 
 access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently 
 because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to 
 forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been 
 restored.
 
 An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More 
 sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to 
 use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. 
 Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by 
 Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for 
 Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.
 
 After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users 
 posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. 
 Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet 
 providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site 
 to far less powerful search engines in China.
 
 Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, 
 BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to 
 censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking 
 individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be 
 filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key 
 words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this 
 week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on 
 Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China
 usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search 
 also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.

 I'm jumping in here since I'm just back on
 ILUG after quite a long break, anyway...
 
 Alan Cox was mentioning that he might have borked
 some PNP stuff lately. You could try 2.4.19-ac4
 to see if it helps.

1805,"Subject: My talk at UT Austin
","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85505995
 Date: Not supplied
 
 I've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas 
 about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he 
 blogged the hell out of the talk: 
 
     Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
     roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), 
     ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax 
     case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would 
     not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the 
     VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the 
     case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a 
     technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. 
     This principle is under attack. 
 
     Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright 
     measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits 
     distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content 
     scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, 
     override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial 
     for creating a piece of code.

 I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
 Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer 
 Skills"">volunteering</a> a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 
 
 
 
 
 Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
 spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
 good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Organization 
 Suggestion"">organizations</a> that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
 seen some very interesting suggestions for <a 
 href=""mailto:tony@Lockergnome.com?subject=Penguin Shell Volunteer name 
 suggestion"">names</a> for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
 above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
 subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
 through my email system.<p>
 
 It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
 According to <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/content/4/26269.html"" 
 target=""_blank"">this</a> article on <a href=""http://theregister.co.uk/"" 
 target=""_blank"">The Register</a>, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
 previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
 upgrade at $129.<p>
 
 I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
 difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
 by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
 2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 
 
 
 
 
 were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 
 
 
 
 
 years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 
 
 
 
 
 free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income <a 
 href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/"" target=""_blank"">sources</a>.<p>
 
 On a brighter note, it looks like <a href=""http://www.mandrake.com/"" 
 target=""_blank"">Mandrake</a> has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
 recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
 company's
 history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
 them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
 only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
 the result of the <a
 href=""http://mandrakelinux.com/en/club/""target=""_blank"">Mandrake Linux User's
 Club</a>.<p>
 
 The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
 partnership venture, an agreement with <a href=""http://www.microtel.com/""
 target=""_blank"">Microtel</a> to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on <a
 href=""http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product_listing.gsp?cat=102252&dept=3944&path=0%3A3944%3A3951%3A41937%3A86796%3A102252"" target=""_blank"">WalMart.com</a>.
 I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
 charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
 addition of both <a href=""http://www/lindows.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lindows</a> 
 and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
 computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.<p>
 
 Have a great Wednesday.<p><p>

 <b>Checking Mail With KMail</b><p>
 
 I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from 
 
 my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, 
 procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
 contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
 desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.<p>
 
 There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
 automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
 time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
 additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
 irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
 configuration issue.<p>
 
 To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in 
 
 your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
 window, change the command line to read:<p>
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m<p>
 
 The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
 you open the program.<p>
 
 Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?<p> <p>

 <b>Kernel Configuration - Part XIII</b><p>
 
 As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
 networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
 stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should 
 
 come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
 configuration is dense with details and options.<p>
 
 I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
 the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
 configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
 You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
 used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). 
 
 Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.<p>
 
 For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:<p>
 
 <a class=""url"" 
 href=""http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/Security-Quickstart-HOWTO/index.html"">The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo</a><br>

 If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
 a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
 the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
 descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
 downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
 company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
 Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
 your favorite OS.<p><p>

 I assume that how much the trust goes down depends of the proportion of 
 report vs revoke. If everybody except one says that a mail is spam, the 
 one guy will see his trust go down dramatically. If you are with the 
 majority, your trust goes up. If you are against the majority, your 
 trust goes down. If people 50-50, whatever you vote, your neither 
 against the majority nor with it, so your trust won't change. So your
 ""gray"" mail won't have much influence on your trust (neither good nor 
 bad, just... gray)

 The Philippines suffers from a Spanish-imposed aristocratic landowner
 class, the same as in most of Latin America, with the serf-like
 relationships that go with it.  You have multiple generations of
 peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a
 human parts of the property package.
 
 The problem in the Philippines is that the landowner class is fading,
 but the peasants are still operating under the old economic assumption
 even though it isn't being imposed on them in most cases.  In a number
 of areas, you have landowners that don't use their lands during bad
 years (i.e. when sugar prices fall too low or some other condition that
 makes planting unprofitable in the global economy) and in some cases
 have all but abandoned them, but when they come back to plant crops
 several years later they find the same peasants living on the fallow
 land as scratch farmers to survive and waiting for the landowner to come
 back and give them something to do.
 
 The government's solution to this was to ""redistribute"" fallow land to
 the peasants that lived on them, and created a number of problems in the
 process.  First of all, it meant that all the agricultural producers had
 to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) or the government would
 seize the land and give it to someone else, which is not economically
 optimal by any means.  Second when they give it to the peasants, they
 use it to become scratch farmers, which is not a particularly productive
 economic activity, and the landowners generally let them do that for
 free when the land is fallow anyway.  Third, the peasants generally
 *prefer* to work for the landowner rather than own the land themselves;
 they make more money, have more opportunities to become middle-class,
 and enjoy a better lifestyle under that arrangement.  So the result of
 all this is that the landowners either run an economically sub-optimal
 agriculture business to protect their lands, or they risk having their
 land seized without compensation and given to the peasants/squatters who
 will gladly sell it back to the plantation owner rather than becoming
 scratch farmers, another economically sub-optimal solution. The only
 real role of the government in this arrangement is to be a drag on the
 economy.
 
 And I don't know about 20 years for land titles in the Philippines.  It
 takes a little longer than in the US (though not much), and you may have
 to bribe someone to make it work well in an expedited manner, but it
 isn't that onerous in the regions I'm familiar with.
 
 Speaking as a former Philippine plantation owner. (Yes, really. On
 Negros and Cebu. Have I led a strange life or what?)

 Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
 definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to
 do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I
 was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
 something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
 several distinct issues.
 
 The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
 that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
 interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
 Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
 Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
 representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on
 exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
 entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
 provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
 substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
 province of Alberta.  
 
 The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
 as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
 much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
 sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
 fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less
 restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
 having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
 Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is
 essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
 inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of
 Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
 dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.
 
 I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
 clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
 unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
 fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the
 Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
 the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

","Hi all,
 
 I have a debian machine with an external ISDN terminal adapter, which 
 I'm trying to get to dial a Cisco 3600 running CHAP. wvdial on Red Hat 
 copes fine with this. However, I get the same results if i use pon or 
 wvdial on Debian: pppd negotiation is detected, pppd is started -- and 
 I'm never assigned an IP address.
 
 Looking at the logs on the Cisco, I see that in place of the username I 
 seem to be transmitting a six-digit hex number. e.g.:
 
 Aug  8 23:35:00.311 UTC+1: %ISDN-6-CONNECT: Interface Serial0/0:19 is 
 now connected to <phonenum> 19eb85
 
 The last entry should be my dialup username. (Substitute incoming phone 
 number for <phonenum>).
 
 Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

 Let me get this straight; a registry key is loaded from the server onto 
 the client workstations who can modify it, then write it back onto the 
 server's own registry - which is not going to use it?

 What is the reason to write a registry key to a server if the server 
 itself is not using it?
 I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
 the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
 the keys on the server.

 And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide 
 open for something nasty here.
 Two other things spring to mind; 
 1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
 not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
 2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
 create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
 registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.
 
 If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
 me where I might have misunderstood.

 Not at 40,000 m. I found this article 
 (http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,53928,00.html) :
 
 ""The last person to try to break the highest free fall record died in 
 the attempt. In 1965, New Jersey truck driver Nick Piantanida suffered 
 catastrophic equipment failure when his facemask blew out at 57,000 
 feet. Lack of oxygen caused such severe brain damage that he went into a 
 coma and died four months later.""
 
 And in amongst the flash at
 http://www.legrandsaut.org/site_en/
 
 you can discover that he will break the sound barrier at 35,000 m,
 presumably reaching top speed somewhere above 30,000.

 Back when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were
 just being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the
 license fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound
 to the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.
 
 I still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour
 block of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them
 up.
 
 If I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either
 spend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do
 or I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write
 some apps to stay in regs ..I dont know..one thing is for sure it
 defiently takes the spontaneous edge off things:)-

 Look at /etc/apt/apt.conf. I think ^kernel$ matches the kernel packages
 (apart from those matched by the rest, smp, enterprise).
 I think it won't do anything about the kernels. Come to think of it, the
 abovementioned might have nothing to do with it.
 
 I explicitly use apt-get install kernel and then from the list pick a
 version and then install kernel#2.4.foo-bar.

 Should. Haven't tried with dist-upgrade but I have put 7.2 netboot
 mirror (ie, 7.2) into sources.list and run install step-by-step for IIRC
 everything. Worked ok. I think there'll be a few .rpmnew files worth
 checking such as, especially, passwd and group.
 I think there was a group change. ""lock"" ?

 Here is what you do.
 
 Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
 Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
 essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.
 
 Turn on the system.
 If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.
 
 Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
 lack of video card then.
 
 Switch it off.
 Remove it's ram.
 
 Same procedure as above.
 
 If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
 last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
 up your system without a heatsink & fan).
 
 If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
 from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
 no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
 have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.
 
 Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
 disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
 Power On Self Test.

 History is written by the victors. If the rabble can put forth there ideas
 they will be tempered in the pages of yore as ""strong willed voices
 decrying the obvious injustices of the day""
 
 Once again, look at the Chicago 7, a loud and rude a crowd of selfish
 pricks as you were want to find in the day. History of course colors them
 with times great blur filter. The jagged bits that , at the time, were
 called rude and obnoxious are now seen as a stab of justive doing in the

 And yet STILL noone is out there creating _public domain_ content. Is there
 even one person out there can can even begin to talk without being a
 complete hypocrite? And no the ""open source"" people cant talk either, the
 GPL aint even close. I know I cant talk.
 
 If the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it's theft, so
 simple, hell that's even in all the major holy books.
 
 Fair use needs to be clarified a bit and then I hope they start locking
 people up. How else do i ever have hope of finding a job working for someone
 that makes things people are supposed to ... *drumroll* pay for.

","PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
 2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
 Irvine CA 92606
 
 July 24, 2002
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET
 
        IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
 by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
 corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
 Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.
 
        ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
 the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
 and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
 shareholders from acting in their own interest.""
 
        ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
 abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
 self-interest, but in self-destruction.
 
        ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
 honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
 employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
 to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
 managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
 existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""
 
        ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
 said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
 regulations and making the market truly free.""

 Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
 interviews on this topic.

 FreeBSD-SA-02:36.nfs                                        Security Advisory
                                                           The FreeBSD Project
 
 Topic:          Bug in NFS server code allows remote denial of service
 
 Category:       core
 Module:         nfs
 Announced:      2002-08-05
 Credits:        Mike Junk <junk@isilon.com>
 Affects:        All releases prior to 4.6.1-RELEASE-p7
                 4.6-STABLE prior to the correction date
 Corrected:      2002-07-19 17:19:53 UTC (RELENG_4)
                 2002-08-01 19:31:55 UTC (RELENG_4_6)
                 2002-08-01 19:31:54 UTC (RELENG_4_5)
                 2002-08-01 19:31:54 UTC (RELENG_4_4)
 FreeBSD only:   NO
 
 I.   Background
 
 The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of
 its filesystems, or parts of them, so that other hosts can access them
 over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks.  NFS is
 built on top of the Sun Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.
 
 II.  Problem Description
 
 A part of the NFS server code charged with handling incoming RPC
 messages had an error which, when the server received a message with a
 zero-length payload, would cause it to reference the payload from the
 previous message, creating a loop in the message chain.  This would
 later cause an infinite loop in a different part of the NFS server
 code which tried to traverse the chain.
 
 III. Impact
 
 Certain Linux implementations of NFS produce zero-length RPC messages
 in some cases.  A FreeBSD system running an NFS server may lock up
 when such clients connect.
 
 An attacker in a position to send RPC messages to an affected FreeBSD
 system can construct a sequence of malicious RPC messages that cause
 the target system to lock up.
 
 IV.  Workaround
 
 1) Disable the NFS server: set the nfs_server_enable variable to ""NO""
    in /etc/rc.conf, and reboot.
 
    Alternatively, if there are no active NFS clients (as listed by the
    showmount(8) utility), just killing the mountd and nfsd processes
    should suffice.
 
 2) Add firewall rules to block RPC traffic to the NFS server from
    untrusted hosts.
 
 V.   Solution
 
 The following patch has been verified to apply to FreeBSD 4.4, 4.5, and
 4.6 systems.
 
 a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
 detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
 
 # fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch
 # fetch ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-02:36/nfs.patch.asc
 
 b) Apply the patch.
 
 # cd /usr/src
 # patch < /path/to/patch
 
 c) Recompile your kernel and modules as described in
 <URL:http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the
 system.

 Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used
 on all transaction in order to process them... So this has some preaty heavy
 implications, unless it's just BS.

 Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
 whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
 Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

 Again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...
 
 > ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly,
 
 Mmmmmmmmmmm, machine code, never a good idea ;)

 Yeah, but these would be different cases relating to copyright infringements,

 DEAR SIR, 
 
 I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.
 
 
 I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  
 
 Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila.

","
 Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article
 that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
 respect for its users.
 
 http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html
 
 There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
 http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html
 
 ""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
 a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
 their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
 engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
 that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
 party or otherwise) was in development.
 
 All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
 private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
 updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
 resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
 place.
 
 But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
 exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
 But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
 ""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
 is not allowed to load.
 
 It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
 ""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
 something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
 vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
 Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
 make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
 APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
 number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
 third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
 desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
 prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.
 
 But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
 effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
 provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. ""

 Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
 pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
 language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
 gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
 Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
 powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

 That won't work like you want.  You'll end up with a boot loader
 on the backup disk that contains the 'physical' location of
 the /boot/map file on the main disk.  That won't necessarily
 be the same as the backup disk.
 
 I can't think of a right way to do his with LILO.  I've got
 a similar seup on my home machine (rsync to a backup disk
 every night), but I'll be pulling out the RH install CDs to
 get LILO sorted if I have to do a disk swap.
 
 GRUB should be able to handle this no problem, since it
 doesn't record sector numbers like LILO does.  Not much help
 for you though...
 
 Later,

 You assume that they just match people up and marry them off, and neither is

 Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good
 
 September 10, 2002
 By MARY DUENWALD 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
 scientific research has suggested that people who have
 strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
 more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
 longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
 to the common cold, studies show. 
 
 But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
 insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
 much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
 attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 
 
 ""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
 Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
 Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
 envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
 rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
 is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
 is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 
 
 Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
 sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
 advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
 ""There's this myth that friendships should last a
 lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
 they end."" 
 
 That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
 the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
 that they have only recently paid close attention to
 friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
 between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
 as more important. 
 
 Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
 to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
 children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
 bad. 
 
 As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
 Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
 best friend hits me."" 
 
 Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
 University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
 like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
 role of friends in emotional and physical health. 
 
 ""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
 stability the way it was in the past, and because people
 are less likely to be living with or near extended family
 members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
 a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
 Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 
 
 Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
 focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
 at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
 a professor of psychology at Florida International
 University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
 negative characteristics."" 
 
 The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
 measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
 So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
 figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
 research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
 friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 
 
 How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
 drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
 pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
 Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
 antisocial behavior."" 
 
 Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
 split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
 psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
 often in cases where one has shared personal information or
 secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""
 
 
 Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
 suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
 more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
 treatment is actually malicious."" 
 
 At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
 romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
 Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
 there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 
 
 A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
 the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
 responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
 described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
 ""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
 that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
 people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 
 
 Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
 but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
 constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
 have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
 she finds out."" 
 
 Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
 kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
 only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
 the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
 overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
 who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
 the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 
 
 Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
 from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
 something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
 promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
 isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 
 
 Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
 when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
 to dislike the other one. 
 
 ""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
 discover there's something important they don't like about
 the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
 ""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
 person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
 it may take even more time for one person to meet the
 other's dislike criteria."" 
 
 Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
 ""depends on how large the injury is."" 
 
 ""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
 something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
 sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 
 
 Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
 spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
 friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
 from each one. 
 
 But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
 one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
 friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
 to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
 or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
 get together, ever. 
 
 ""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
 but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 
 
 Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
 easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
 comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
 bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
 appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 
 
 ""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
 them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
 are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
 when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
 health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
 course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
 life-preserving good friendship is.""

 Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't 
 support the icon window.
 
 However, I did fix some bugs in the related ""Hide When Empty"" functionality 
 which may solve the issue.  You may need to remove ""unseen"" from the ""always 
 show sequences"" to make this work.  If so, let me know so I can put that in 
 the help window for ""Icon Window"" as it already is for ""Hide When Empty"".

","URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde
 Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00
 
 So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her 
 company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a 
 tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
 remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 
 reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 
 honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 
 that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 
 tilde. 
 
 Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home 
 directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 
 will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 
 their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 
 trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 
 pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 
 have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 
 commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html 
 subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 
 your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files 
 from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. 
 
 But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. 
 
 As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 
 this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
 old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 
 Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 
 tilde. 
 
 In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
 used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 
 tilde in its URL. 
 
 Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. 
 
 Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 
 that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 
 character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 
 indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 
 to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 
 The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; 
 (now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along 
 the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 
 uses. 
 
 Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
 #[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 
 even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 
 1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 
 meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 
 SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 
 what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 
 when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. 
 
 And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 
 yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google 
 Groups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William 
 Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 
 pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
 [10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 
 cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
 ASCII characters. 
 
 As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
 [11]. 
 
 In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. 
 
 In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
 Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. 
 
 As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. 
 
 As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. 
 
 In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 
 (history,tilde,job control)[16]. 
 
 As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 
 in the APL-11 character set[18]. 
 
 In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 
 bugs in csh). 
 
 In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting 
 this typographical pun[21]. 
 
 And that's the earliest reference I can find. 
 
 So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 
 there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 
 tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 
 &#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 
 to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
 sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
 my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. 
 May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

 I honestly don't know.  I made that list a long time ago, and certainly

 1.  I muffed that part, the first time, and was talking through my hat.

5178,"Subject: Native American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman
","
 I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived on
 a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest
 and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my
 parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than
 I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
 do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
 from my father.
 
 The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
 it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
 is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
 consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
 something that was impressed upon them.
 
 The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
 that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
 Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
 single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
 tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
 tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
 person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
 places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
 businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.
 
 You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
 are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
 share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
 high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
 take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
 corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
 purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
 works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
 dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
 they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
 that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
 many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
 folk, not Indians.
 
 Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
 receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
 to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
 benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
 ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.
 
 It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
 ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
 very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
 credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
 Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
 billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
 gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
 dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
 case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
 drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
 intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
 actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
 there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
 million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
 government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
 particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
 per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
 borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
 the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
 dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
 than their own pockets.
 
 Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
 assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
 where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
 companies.  And the cycle continues.
 
 So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
 nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.
 
 Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
 gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
 pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
 substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
 the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
 earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
 reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
 these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
 arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
 etc).
 
 In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
 shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
 have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
 that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
 could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
 you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
 it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
 guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
 if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
 a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
 openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
 will give you an interesting perspective on things.)
 
 There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
 Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
 intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
 where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
 they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
 leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
 cases mentioned above.
 
 The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
 by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
 when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
 just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
 ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
 poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
 original point.
 
 
 On a tangent:
 
 One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
 corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
 socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
 structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
 interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
 over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.
 
 It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
 voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
 society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
 the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
 individuals.
 
 Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.

 Indeed, my usual login is ""dude"" (and has been since long before ""The Big
 Lebowsky"" came out ;-)), and it seems the some programs wrongly hard code
 my home directory when being compiled :-(
 For instance :
 
 [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/gentoo | grep dude
 /home/dude/
 [dude@python dude]$ strings /usr/bin/xine | grep dude
 /home/dude/redhat/tmp/xine-root/usr/share/locale
 
 These should probably be considered bugs in the program's build process
 (especially for xine, look at that!), I'll report them upstream if/when I
 have some time.
 
 Thanks for noticing this!

 Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
 bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY
 matters.

","This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and 
 mh.
 
 Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail 
 server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that 
 facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the 
 stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to 
 rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is 
 unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the 
 spool.
 
 I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:
 
 1)  Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.  This 
 means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "".  Any such line will 
 look like "">From "".
 
 2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"".  When I was 
 having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, 
 then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but 
 you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.
 
 3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
 letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the 
 whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and 
 everything works.

2978,"Subject: Keeping up with The Sims: Managing Large Scale Game Content
","URL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-0,8613666,159/
 Date: 2002-10-06T18:12:54+01:00
 
 With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
 margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure 
 to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat 
 competition. No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when 
 creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
 Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. 
 This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset 
 production needed for today's most demanding games.
 
 
"
4203,"Subject: Re: The Great Power-Shortage Myth
","> The only circumstances in which a business will not be ready--indeed,

 That is a fully retarded view of economics, and pretty much the same kind
 of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts.  There are a
 bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of
 California messed up and the energy producers exploited.
 
 I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like
 the blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the people
 who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and
 exploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state
 of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  
 If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't
 necessarily the answer.
 
 You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people 
 involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their 
 jobs.
 
 The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote
 the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good
 rules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway.

 Hi
 
 I have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new
 to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.
 
 The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly
 miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes
 ). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),
 and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.
 
 Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT
 Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again
 it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.
 
 If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.
 Please keep in mind I am new to it though.
 
 Thanks
 
 Mark

 Well, in sylheed's ""claws"" branch you need to wait a bit for the developers
 to backport all the updates from the main branch before getting a release
 with the same version number.
 
 Right now, the latest ""claws"" release is still 0.8.2claws :

 But as it's the primary mailer I use, you can be sure that as soon as it's

 Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2
 
 
 Folks,
 
 my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.
 
 
 Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
 disk
 for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
 went
 fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
 I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
 GeForce4
 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
 default
 set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
 RPM.
 Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
 but
 it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
 Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
 twice,
 the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
 is
 inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
 If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
 I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
 Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
 Opinions
 welcome.
 
 Thanks a lot,
 Peter

 Testis tissue from goats and pigs has been grafted onto the backs of mice
 and shown to produce normal sperm, capable of fertilising eggs. <br>
 It is the first time testis tissue from such distant species has produced
 mature sperm when grafted in mice. &quot;It might work for primates or
 even humans,&quot; claims Ina Dobrinski of the University of
 Pennsylvania, one of the co-authors of the study. <br>
 If so, the technique could be used to preserve the reproductive potential
 of male cancer patients about to undergo therapies that would destroy
 their ability to make sperm.<br>
 Men often freeze sperm samples before receiving chemotherapy, but young
 boys cannot do this because they do not produce mature sperm. If it works
 in humans, the technique would allow testis tissue grafted from boys to
 mature and produce sperm.<br><br>
 Infectious particles <br>
 The mouse grafting technique also has an advantage over another option
 for preserving fertility - testicular transplants. These involve
 re-implanting preserved germ cells into the testes after cancer
 remission. <br>
 But the grafting approach &quot;would eliminate any possibility of
 passing cancer cells back to the patient,&quot; says reproductive
 biologist Michael Griswold from Washington State University.<br>
 However, it is possible that the grafting procedure could introduce
 mouse-derived infectious particles into human embryos, making some
 scientists wary of the idea. &quot;I would very much hesitate to say that
 it's something we should be doing,&quot; says reproductive biologist
 Roger Gosden of the East Virginia Medical School.<br><br>
 Castrated mice <br>
 In the study, Dobrinski and colleagues placed small pieces of testis
 tissue from newborn goats or pigs just under the skin on the backs of
 castrated mice. Two to four weeks later, they found that more than half
 of the 477 grafts had survived and were producing normal-looking goat or
 pig sperm.<br>
 When they injected the graft-derived sperm directly into eggs they saw
 clear signs of fertilisation, indicating that the sperm function
 normally. The researchers also found that the procedure worked just as
 well with testis tissue that had been refrigerated for two days or frozen
 for several weeks.<br>
 Gosden has tried transplanting human testes tissue into mice, but was not
 successful. However, Dobrinski believes the technique could soon be used
 to preserve the germ lines of endangered species, including rare animals
 that usually die in captivity before reaching sexual maturity. &quot;We
 think that's a very real application,&quot; she says.<br>
 She adds that mice with human testis tissue grafts would also be useful
 to scientists who want to test the effects of toxic substances and new
 contraceptives on human sperm production. <br>

   <b>Oracle challenges Microsoft anew</b></a></font><br>
 
 Oracle is taking on Microsoft's Exchange with a <b>Collaboration Suite</b> that includes e-mail, calendar and messaging software. Oracle has pitched its products as Microsoft replacements before -- with spectacularly little success. (At Comdex last November, the database giant offered its 9i and app-server software as a more secure <b>alternative to Exchange</b>.) What's different this time? Oracle is selling a separate collaboration product that, says CEO <b>Larry Ellison</b>, is cheaper than rival offerings. Plus: Companies facing a deadline to join Redmond's new <b>licensing program</b> may be more open to non-Micrososft alternatives.

","Could anyone who is interested clarify this for me.
 Or point me in the direction of a site that does GPL case studies where there may be a similar issue. I have had a google around and the PHP site wasn't help full and the GPL page didn't seem to have this senario.
 
 The setup is as follows:
 I develop a piece of code using PHP 3.0.9 which is, to
 my knowledge, GPL. 
 
 The piece of code runs on my server and is an integral part of a system that I have developed for a client. I did not recieve  payment for this particular piece of code but I did recieve payment for the system. My client now wants to  
 use a different service provider but keep my code. 
 Do I have a right to claim intellectual property rights for  my little piece of code that he did not pay me for or do I have to give the client the code under the GPL.
 
 I know this is not strictly a 'Linux' issue but any help would be appreciated

 Content-Type: text/plain;

 I installed Spamassassin 2.41 with Razor V2 the other day and it has =
 been working great. I decided to add Pyzor last night and I got that =
 installed successfully (I think, no errors). I am using spamd and I see =
 where it periodically spawns off a pyzor process; however nothing has =
 been detected as spam by Pyzor under Spamassassin. It has been running =
 for almost half a day now on a 5,000 user mail server - so to me the =
 odds of something being caught by it should be high. I run spamd as =
 follows:
 
 spamd -d -H
 
 and all my users home directories have a .pyzor directory with the =
 server listed under it.
 
 I setup a test procmail recipe that just invokes pyzor check and not =
 spamc to see if in fact pyzor alone catches any spam -  I just set this =
 up so no results yet. Here is what I get when I check connectivity to =
 the pyzor server:
 
  pyzor -d ping
 sending: 'User: anonymous\nTime: 1031921041\nSig: =
 161c547ac6248589910f97b1b5cd37e6dffc8eaf\n\nOp: ping\nThread: 14733\nPV: =
 2.0\n\n'

 167.206.208.233:24442   (200, 'OK')
 
 Any help/examples would be appreciated. Thanks! BTW, keep up the great =
 work Spamassassin team!

 Excellent evidence of the herd. Just imagine if the anonymous noise injected into our world newsphere (noosphere?) was, say, a fraudulent story that a stock accounting scandal had been accused and the evildoers were shorting. 
 
 Oh, wait, that happened. An unemployed Orange County student took down Emulex...

 Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All
 
 October 2, 2002
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""
 
 
 Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
 World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
 would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
 was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
 reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
 program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 
 
 There was only one problem, the health organization said in
 a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
 would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
 subject. 
 
 ""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
 originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
 Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
 have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 
 
 All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
 cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
 blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
 But none reported any scientific details from the study or
 the names of the scientists who conducted it. 
 
 On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
 conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
 ""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
 is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
 and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
 blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
 within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
 brunets."" 
 
 Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""
 
 
 Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
 anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
 who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 
 
 In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
 unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
 Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
 the last true blond to hail from Finland. 
 
 The British accounts were replete with the views of
 bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
 blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
 genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
 endangered species. 
 
 Journalists in London said last night that the source of
 the reports was probably one of several European news
 agencies that are used by the British press, but it
 remained unclear which one. 
 
 Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
 report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
 Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
 up,"" he said. 
 
 But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
 Association, said that although it had considered running
 the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
 to the World Health Organization. 
 
 ""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
 World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us
 that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
 time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
 German news agency."" 
 
 She added that she did not know which agency the
 organization was referring to. 
 
 Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
 at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
 blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""

 Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has 
 been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to 
 sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a 
 one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages 
 removed.  (I think.)

 That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and 
 Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it 
 only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the 
 ""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences 
 are actually reread from disk.
 
 
 My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to 
 investigate that.

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531633
 Date: Not supplied
 
 The DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
 through ""a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
 at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
 vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:"" 
 
     Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
     system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
     along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
     evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
     data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable  such 
     as collecting seismic data at the drill bit  may now be possible. 
 
     With high-resolution seismic data collected ""ahead of the bit,"" operators 
     could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
     spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
     of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
     reservoir.

 My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled
 2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
 (quite the opposite, in fact).
 
 I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the
 kernel has an option specifically for the Via C3), but I assume that was
 a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.

 Strange.
 
 I had the double IRQ problem with the 3c509 combo, 
 and turning pnp off in the card's firware fixed it.
 
 As far as I remember the problem I was having was 
 that the driver was assigning an IRQ to the card's
  RJ45 port and then another IRQ to it's BNC port,
  and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq,
  and turning off PnP in the card's firmware fixed that.
 
 You must be having a different error
 Else
 PnP is still turned on.
 <<Obvious suggestion entails>>
 Making sure the IRQ and io space you assign
 the card in it's firmware is not in use by
 any other ISA devices.

 Saturday, July 20, 2002<p>
 <p>
 <b>Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Compute=
 r trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it migh=
 t be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
 </b>
 <p>
 Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by <a href=3D""http://clickth=
 ru.online.com/Click?q=3D14-5MRAIF-I438XVu98ZvQIzTKtR1dR"" >unveiling</a> new=
  iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
 <p>
 The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u=
 se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi=
 sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with=
  a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo=
 r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m=
 odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.
 <p>
 As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=
 itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=
 ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.
 <p>
 Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will =
 be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with =
 improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=
 he background photo as often as every 5 seconds.
 <p>
 But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch=
 eap upgrade when the company announced it will <a href=3D""http://clickthru.=
 online.com/Click?q=3D29-Sg_rIjM3xjSzf59NyGEI9rCM8vcR"" >not offer</a> a disc=
 ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr=
 ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h=
 ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=
 em for the retail price of $129.
 <p>
 Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=
 alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s=
 hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser=
 vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou=
 s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.
 <p>
 Apple also raised eyebrows by <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
 q=3D3e-F51nIizcfoh9HOq_7DQESNPe-iRR"" >transitioning</a> its iTools Web serv=
 ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t=
 o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service=
 s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=
  service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu=
 res.
 <p>
 Despite iTool's popularity, the company <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.=
 com/Click?q=3D53-n86dINniBiqIX-sjHpx8lOheMnlR"" >may face a tough sell</a> w=
 ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=
 . Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =
 free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=
  free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to=
  form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=
 .
 <p>
 To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=
  services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz=
 ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,=
  an <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D68-iM8qIsPWu8FuzAvywvj=
 sK-FdLP4R"" >online petition</a> protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel=
 l for the program.

  rebate</a> for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software=
  bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=
 bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for=
  those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.
 <p>
 The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=
 t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=
  copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =
 program went on sale last November.
 <p>
 Microsoft is also putting the <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
 q=3D93-V4PmQSdrF0o9nH2cTYjvQ8Rgn5FR"" >finishing touches</a> on the third co=
 llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=
  a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c=
 ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=
 perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co=
 uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=
 ixes are available as separate downloads.
 <p>
 
 Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro=
 soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has <a href=3D""http://clickt=
 hru.online.com/Click?q=3Da8-02XZQQZDjZijEBtDtZs6swzdON9R"" >shut down</a> a =
 site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T=
 he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java =
 inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the=
  forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.

 <b><font color=3D""#CC0000"">Somebody's watching you</font></b><br>
 
 You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah=
 oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter=
  to <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Dbd-c0nUQ7pV9moRKw2pAEV=
 gnfqGsJuR"" >swap out</a> a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that=
  pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
 <p>
 The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contai=
 n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS=
 cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=
  to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =
 example.
 <p>
 ""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced =
 e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will =
 open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=
 nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =
 line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'=
 s knowledge.
 <p>
 
 On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g=
 overnment is again turning to technology to <a href=3D""http://clickthru.onl=
 ine.com/Click?q=3Dd2-THo_QULs_DzX3rh3Gl22vbAOyesR"" >monitor suspicious acti=
 vity</a> in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor=
 e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan=
  to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =
 suspicious behavior.
 <p>
 ""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail=
 y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=
  or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. =
 But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,=
  fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=
 ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

7104,"Subject: Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter?OLIBYKN
","How are you doing?
 
 If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
 EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
 - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
 equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
 either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
 weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.
 
 You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
 miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
 my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
 so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
 to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
 the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
 as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
 to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
 at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
 
 I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
 and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
 the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
 does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
 I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
 absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
 
 If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
 any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
 then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
 
 You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
 actually work?""
 
 Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
 is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
 weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 
 
 Here is the bottom line ...
 
 I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
 exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
 Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
 to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my
 pledge to you.
 
 BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

 Well, with 7.0, I've seen a few problems with doing that, but as of 7.2
 it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh
 related packages while being connected through ssh? Well, it works!!!! Of
 course, if the connection cuts at that moment, you're stuck, but a simple
 upgrade with official Red Hat packages also works like a charm :-)

 Thanks, Tabor.  How do I install v1 over v2, and where does one

 Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't 
 support the icon window.
 
 However, I did fix some bugs in the related ""Hide When Empty"" functionality 
 which may solve the issue.  You may need to remove ""unseen"" from the ""always 
 show sequences"" to make this work.  If so, let me know so I can put that in 
 the help window for ""Icon Window"" as it already is for ""Hide When Empty"".

 Well, I've made an updated libsigc++ 1.0.4 package. It rebuilds cleanly on

 AOL KEYWORD: FRAUD PROBE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Another three bite the dust. Three former executives from real
 estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal 
 charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more
 interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into 
 AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate
 drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen
 Ross.""
 
 Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and
 conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail),
 the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five
 years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but
 unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which
 Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company
 then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would
 supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus
 allowing Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own
 cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal.
 
 Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John
 Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush 
 administration really means it about this corporate clean-up
 thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC
 named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a
 major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time
 Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with,
 observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while
 investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was
 inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.
  
 The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at
 former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and
 expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted
 Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do
 its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked
 legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already
 been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another
 company; his boss got booted last month for possible
 book-cooking. 
 
 So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that 
 make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but 
 that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this
 comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had
 one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice
 chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey
 team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority
 owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he
 lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone
 as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no
 Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. -

 VIVENDI MEETS THE NEW BOSS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 What does Vivendi want to be when it grows up? The media can't
 figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou? His fuzziness at
 yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he
 can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20
 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For
 Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the
 comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he
 resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the vilified
 Jean-Marie Messier.
 
 Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's
 latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets
 devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24 
 paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in
 an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.  
 The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still 
 had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's
 influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more like a
 rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation.""
 
 There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The
 company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth
 of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters
 examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu, 
 an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a
 maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing
 properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake 
 in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom, via
 its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment
 properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's
 plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote.
 To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in
 the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according
 to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd
 consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll
 increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone
 conference. 
 
 The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was
 his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier.
 ""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian
 quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his 
 head."" 
 
 With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's
 viability again in doubt? Outlets today report that Enron's
 logo, the oversize capital ""E"" that stood outside its
 headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. How many euros might
 a V bring? - Deborah Asbrand

 					<P>Another three bite the dust. Three former executives from real estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen Ross.""</P><P>
 Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail), the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus allowing
 Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal.</P><P>
 Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush administration really means it about this corporate clean-up thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with, observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while
 investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.<br>
  <br>
 The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another company; his boss got booted last month for possible book-cooking.
 </P><P>
 So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he
 lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no Jack Welsh/GE $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

 					<P>What does Vivendi want to be when it grows up? The media can't figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Ren&eacute; Fourtou? His fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the
 vilified Jean-Marie Messier.</P><P>
 Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24 paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.  The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more
 like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation.""</P><P>
 There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu, an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom,
 via its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone
 conference. </P><P>
 The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier. ""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his head."" </P><P>
 With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's viability again in doubt? Outlets today report that Enron's logo, the oversize capital ""E"" that stood outside its headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. How many euros might a V bring? - Deborah Asbrand</P><P>

","http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/09/technology/09KORE.html
 
 Broadband's killer application  the one activity that dwarfs all others 
 is online gaming, which 80 percent of South Koreans under 25 play, according
 to one recent study. Critics say the burgeoning industry is creating
 millions of zombified addicts who are turning on and tuning into computer
 games, and dropping out of school and traditional group activities, becoming
 uncommunicative and even violent because of the electronic games they play.
 
 ""Game players don't have normal social relationships anymore,"" said Kim Hyun
 Soo, a 36-year-old psychiatrist who is chairman of the Net Addiction
 Treatment Center, one of many groups that have sprung up to cope with
 Internet game addiction. ""Young people are losing the ability to relate to
 others, except through games. People who become addicted are prone to
 violence, even when they are not playing.

 *********************************
 AQUEOUS KATHMANDU
 *********************************
 
 For those who choose not to smoke ... we have something for you.  Introducing Aqueous Kathmandu ""Happy Drops"" (tm).
 
 Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Happiness Drops....(Temple ""Quantum"" Variety)....Indeed; a Happiness Brew from the Kathmandu....a.k.a. ""Secret Fire""....from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene.... Who du the Kathmandu?  Now....everybody can du the Kathmandu!  (that is, if you're 21 years of age or older....)  Aqueous Kathmandu is engaged to holistically inspire and instill ""sensitive/responsive""; happiness and mellowness without the detriment of carcinogenic inhalation (smoking).  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors!!!! 
 
 As ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored/concentrated liquid product to fruition. This has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons.  Finally; we are able to say that this task has been accomplished....a ""Sensitive"" herbal/botanical awakening, if you will....as we have introduced and brought to market Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops, Temple ""Quantum"" Variety, a.k.a....""Secret Fire"".  ""Secret fire""....indeed!!!
 
 This liquid innovation affords us four factors within this particular botanical equation that were previously not realized....
 1) The ability to engage a more substantial, high-ratio, concentrated application of particular botanical factors that are utilized in our personal-choice, ""sensitive/responsive"" pipe-smoking product.
 2) The ability to extract high-ratio concentrates of certain botanical factors that are not applicable to a smoking commodity, as they cannot be extracted into dry format.  (Please note....all botanical factors included in all/any of our products are absolutely legal.  In the instance of Aqueous Kathmandu, we are simply able to enjoy the advantages of specific legal herbas that just are not dry concentrate-applicable.
 3) A most notable assimilation factor....being that liquid is more easily and therefore more generally metabolistically assimilated and as such, more ""absolute""; in that herba/botanical applications via the administrative vehicle of ""Smoke"" possess a much wider variance in just how efficiently that ""Smoke"" is integrated metabolistically, psychologically and perspectively
 4) Therein, we have created a unique uniqueness between a ""Smoke"" and a ""non-Smoke""....sort of like the camaraderie between indicas and sativas, if you will....different aspects of the same botanical genus arrangement.  Each ""impeccable"" singularly.... And at this juncture we will also mention to those of you who are not so anti-smoking something....that Aqueous Kathmandu (tm) Happiness Drops and the more traditional Temple ""3"" Ragga Dagga (tm) personal-choice, pipe-smoking substance indeed establish an enchanting ""camaraderie"". (Please refer to, ""Introductory Offers"".) 
 
 * No need to smoke.  No carcinogenic factors!
 * Absolutely legal!  No prescription required!
 * Does not include cannibis or any tobacco variety.
 * Marvelously potent.  Remarkably substantial!
 * Inspires contemplativeness and creativity!
 * Adjusts attitude & mood enhancement. Relaxes stress & anxiety.
 * Better than Kava Kava, St. John's Wort, etc.  Similar to but variant from Ragga Dagga.
 * Certainly safer than pharmaceuticals!
 * Many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives!
 * Better sleeping ... better dreaming.
 * Non-invasive ... no downside.
 * An exquisite compliment with Temple 3 Ragga Dagga (tm) -- (See Intro Offers)
 * Quite simply ... it is a Superior product!
 
 Contents: Aqueous Kathmandu is a unique botanical substantiality.  It is offered and marketed as such.  Undisputedly, it achieves ""distinctive accolade"" of its own merit....  Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled or regulated or harmful herbs or cannabis factors.  However, it is our mandatory ethical policy that Aqueous Kathmandu not be offered to individuals who have not yet attained at least 21 years of age (all things in their time....).  Please note as well that Aqueous Kathmandu is not intended for usage during work or while driving.  And, as is true of all substance and indulgence, this product should not be enjoyed during pregnancy.  This proprietary formulation does include the following quantum-ratio, core-extracted/refined botanicals in an alcohol base as a preservative: Albizzia flower-tops, Drachsha, Chavana Prash, Lactuca Virosa, Hybrid Flowering Turnera Diffusa, Wild Dagga, Capillaris Herba, Angelica Root, Zizyphi Spinosae, Buplerum, Hybrid Valeriana officinalis Root, Albizzia flower-tops, mature Polygonum Vine, Calea Zacatechichi, Crocus Sativa flower-tops, Leonorus Sibricus buds, Cinnabaris, Margarita herba, Biotae Orientalis, Salviae Miltiorrhizae....

 **************************
 STONEY MAHONEY
 **************************
 
 In regard to the introduction of Stoney Mahoney (tm) ""personal choice"" smoking substantiality product, we have strived for years to develop a consummate ""Sensitive/Responsive"" (loose-leaf) smoking product, ""Amsterdam Cup"" style so to speak!
 
 With acquired knowledge via the development of such notable ""personal choice"" smokeables, as Wizard Smoke (tm), Dream Smoke (tm), Dragon Smoke (tm), Vajroli Mudra (tm), Stashish (tm), ShemHampHorash (tm), Yerba lena Yesca (tm), Weed (tm), Kathmandu Temple Kiff (tm) 1 & 2 & 3, which for the most part have been proprietary formulations, of which the rights have been sold to other less aggressive, less developmental companies, we arrived at the lofty ""personal choice"" smoking status of our premier Ragga Dagga (tm) solid pipe-smoking product.  
 
 After all of this, we had come to the technological and philosophical point of view that we could not conjure a loose-leaf formulation that would provide effectuality that would be more significant than that of our much-heralded Ragga Dagga (tm) solid-format pipe smoking product.  Mostly, we were right about this, as this new Stoney Mahoney ""agenda"" is not so much significant as in ""better"", but ""Signature Significant"" as in ""uniqueness,"" in that we chanced upon a new world class, botanical source for the rare ""true-brid"" variety of Artemisia absinthum (flowering tops only), which at one time in history was distilled into ""Absinthe,"" a greenish, aniseed flavored liqueur which heralded certain euphoric and narcotic attributes which ultimately resulted in it being declared illegal.  As well, we have finally perfected our exclusive ""kiffening"" technique, which inspires and establishes alkaloid and glycoside potentiation (enhancement) on a molecular level.  Hence, we introduce (although supply is limited) this highly ""potentiated"" Stoney Mahoney (tm) smoking product! Loose-leaf ""personal choice"" doesnt get any ""sweeter"" than this!  
 
 And for all of you Ragga Dagga fans, please note that, indeed, it isnt so much that Stoney Mahoney loose-leaf is more viripotent than the Ragga Dagga solid-format.  Moreover, it is that Stoney Mahoney is effective in a much different way than Ragga Dagga.  Sort of like apples and oranges, like Panamanian and Jamaican, like Indica and Sativa, if you will!  Within our test marketing, even traditional ""Kind Bud"" aficionados have magnanimously acclaimed this Stoney Mahoney jester variety.  Most folks say that Ragga Dagga motivates them in an up ""Sativa"" sort of way, and that Stoney Mahoney mellows them out or giggles them out in a ""soma,"" Indica sort of way.  If Stoney Mahoney has any shortcoming at all, it is quite simply that due to the extreme ""kiffening"" of this product, it may be to the uninitiated practitioner, a harsh draw.  It is for this reason that in addition to the inclusion of a standard herb pipe and package of rolling papers, we also include a brass, personal water-pipe (hookah).  As is true for many high-minded folks, a water-pipe filled with chilled water or wine will temperament the demonstrativeness of Stoney Mahoneys draw.  
 
 * Indica oriented.
 * Definitely happy smoking!
 * Mood enhancer.
 * Smokeable & brewable mood food!
 * Good-bye stress, anxiety, & restlessness.
 * Sleep deep -- Good-bye funky dreams!
 * Hornier than horny goatweed!
 * Superlative mixer with Ragga Dagga and/or Aqueous Kathmandu.
 * Roll it or bowl it or brew it ...
 * Just a pinch goes a long, long way ...
 * Possesses many fine ganja virtues with none of the negatives.
 * Non-invasive.
 * Absolutely Legal!
 * Rolling papers, herb pipe & personal brass water pipe (hookah)are included.
 
 Attention! Attention! We have, by popular demand and in the interest of good economics, created an introductory offer that features both Ragga Dagga and Stoney Mahoney products and, also, still another introductory offer which includes Ragga Dagga, Stoney Mahoney and, for you non-smokers, our Aqueous Kathmandu Happiness Drops (these are pretty special!).  And to mention furthermore, for non-smokers, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) loose-leaf product is also a brewable delight.  A tea for thee.)
 
 Please Note:  Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is an absolutely legal, herba/botanical, ""Personal Choice,"" loose-leaf substantiality smoking product!  No included botanical factor therein is regulated by law or considered to be harmful by regulatory agencies.  There is no tobacco in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  There is certainly no cannabis/marijuana in Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm).  And although we are not age-governed by law, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is intended exclusively for sophisticated adult usage! Subsequently, it is our MANDATORY ethical policy that Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) may not be sold, offered, or given to any person that has not attained at least twenty-one years of age.  As well, Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving.  It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician's care in any regard.
 
 Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety) (tm), factored in an Absinthium Labyrinthine Configuration, is an exclusive, kiffened, loose-leaf, primo modino, ""Sensitive/Responsive,"" Smoking and/or Brewing Herba which may be, depending upon preference, rolled or bowled or brewed.
 
 As is an herbalists way, three or four draws of Smoke should be inhaled and retained.  For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herba as a potentiated tea/brew.  (Steep approximately one tea-spoon of Stoney Mahoney herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.)  When smoking Stoney Mahoney, please draw gently as Stoney Mahoney is a most preeminent ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoke and may be considered to be a harsh draw to the uninitiated practitioner.  (Water-pipe is included with each package of Stoney Mahoney (Jester Variety).)
 
 Stoney Mahoney contains and is kiffened with the following exotica botanicals and botanical extracts & essences: Dutch Lactuca virosa, Bulgarian Artemisia absinthum (flowering-tops only), Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Chinese Valeriana ceae, Jamaican Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus boldo, and European (flowering-tops only) Sarothamnus Scoparius. Stoney Mahoney does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Stoney Mahoney does indeed achieve distinction upon its own merit....

 duly noted
 
 definately would make the extra effort to talk directly with these people
 and mention to the IFC (local arts cinema) about a more approriate
 showing.
 
 Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs
 of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning.
 
 Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already.
 
 I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer
 cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.
 
 Is this the same film the 2600 people are always going on about or is that
 something else?

 Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
 bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY

","Sunday I drove from Portland down to the Woodburn Dragstrip to check out 
 the NEDRA Nationals. <http://www.nedra.com/>
 
 The electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and I 
 ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...
 
 John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a 
 14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that 
 hasn't been broken in yet. He expects to break his record next year 
 topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 
 12 second run.
 
 John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph 
 run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)
 
 Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph 
 run. Talk about a crotch rocket.

","Mornin' all,
 	Last night, i was involved in an epic struggle to write a shell
 script to do a certain task. The battle raged for hours, but, i'm glad
 to inform you, i emerged victorious. The problem was as follows:
 	It's very easy to get one program to act on the output of a second
 program: cmd1 | cmd2. But, what if you want cmd1 to act on the output of
 cmd2 as well? Hmm. Eventually, I came up with this solution:
 
 	mkfifo io
 	cmd1 <io | cmd2 > io
 	
 and bingo, all was well with the world. Now, I have (and had) a sneaking
 suspcion that it might be possible to do this without using a fifo, and
 can be done using something like:
 
 	exec 3>&1
 	cmd1 <&3 | cmd2 >&3
 	exec 3>&-
 
 but that doesn't work in that form, and i couldn't work out an
 incantation that would. Anyone got any suggestions? Anyway, victory is
 mine, and i is happy person once again. In case you were wondering, the
 aim of all of this was to write a shell script that could check for new
 mail on an imap server.

 While I am in Linux, the following message is the output when I
 execute fdisk /mbr, even though the drive is in read and write mode:
 
 Unable to open /mbr
 
 The mbr is on a separate drive -- not related to the Linux drive.

 But some plonker will come up with yet another computer model
 predicting global warming and storms and floods in 50 years even
 though it can't predict next week's weather.  And predict widespread
 cooling in some parts of the globe (which is now part of global
 ""warming"").  And will get plenty of publicity for even more conclusive
 scaremong^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H proof.

 Umpteen studies have already shown that temperature variations, when
 even detectable in the noise, go either way depending on which data
 you look at.

 One study from Vienna showed long-term warming from thermometers at
 the airport, and none from other sites.  Another study with data from
 Antarctica which was touted as supporting global warming while being
 free from this urbanization effect later turned out to be dominated by
 the time of day at which the airplane that made the measurements flew

 Just one more info. I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
 Ftoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference 
 between mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use 
 the address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the 
 problem.
 
 Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?

    MARINE AQUARIUM
    Version: 0.99.0
    File size: 3MB
    License: Free to try; $12.95 to buy
    Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X
 
    As the name suggests, this program puts an incredibly
    realistic aquarium of saltwater fish on your screen. You can
    select from a variety of highly textured fish to swim across
    your desktop, and you can control variables such as lighting
    and the number of fish. There is even a starfish that you can
    track over time to watch how it adapts to its environment.

    QUICKTIME
    Version 6.0
    File size: 402K
    License: Free
    Minimum requirements: Mac OS 8.6/9.x or Mac OS X
 
    The latest version of Apple's premiere media application
    supports the increasingly popular MPEG-4 codec for high-
    quality, highly compressed video, as well as modern formats
    such as AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) and JPEG 2000. It also
    provides skip protection, an enhanced user interface with a
    more intuitive and useful Favorites menu, new developer APIs,
    and other useful features such as support for Flash 5 files.

    CARTOON EDITOR
    Version: 1.2.1
    File size: 2.38MB
    License: Free
    Minimum requirements: Mac OS X
 
    Cartoon Editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
    overnight. But what this graphic editor will do is make quick
    work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--
    and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.
    Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which
    you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
    group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
    cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for
    some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
    antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

    with MoonDock, a simple piece of software that tracks the
    phases of the moon for you and displays lovely images of our
    planet's companion satellite on your desktop. The images are
    high-quality color photos that change over time in accordance
    with the date. MoonDock includes both astronomical and survey
    data, meaning that you can calculate the appropriate moon
    phase for a particular date and identify topographical
    features on the moon using a built-in catalog of those that
    have been surveyed by astronomers and astronauts. This update
    incorporates improved help features and a few bug fixes.

 Gimme a break.  This is remarkable for its lack of
 newsworthiness.
 
 1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and
 still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.
 You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.
   http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html
 
 2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical
 computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns.
 You can read about it in Kahn.
 
 3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for
 decades.  There's a lot more to it than just holography.
 I get 14,000 hits from
   http://www.google.com/search?q=optical-computing
 
 > Optical info is a complex-valued wave (spatial frequency, amplitude and

 It isn't right to make it sound like three numbers (frequency,
 amplitude, and phase);  actually there are innumerable
 frequencies, each of which has its own amplitude and phase.

 Some things that are hard with wires are easy with
 light-waves.  But most things that are easy with wires
 are hard with light-waves.

 Not ""FFTs"".  FTs.  Fourier Transforms.  All you need for
 taking a D=2 Fourier Transform is a lens.  It's undergrad
 physics-lab stuff.  I get 6,000 hits from:

 All optical???  No optoelectronics anywhere???
 That's medicinal-grade pure snake oil, USP.
 
 Photons are well known for not interacting with
 each other.  It's hard to do computing without
 interactions.

 So, just write-protect the hard disk for partitions that are static.
 I seem to recall an article on this (early 80's, Byte magazine, perhaps?)
 for BBS systems or for testing unknown (perhaps trojan horse) software.

     I had that too; I removed libusb (I don't think it needed --nodeps) and then 'apt-get -f install' and all was well.

1900,"Subject: [ILUG] The Age Old 'Which Mailer' Question
","I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with
 hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
 working nice and easily.
 At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
 mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
 to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
 This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
 It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
 from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
 ""To:"" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
 The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
 use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
 when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
 checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
 to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
 the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
 configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
 files like sendmail.
 
 Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
 are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
 scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
 fine.
 
 Thanks,

 Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast 
 amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not 
 only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected 
 need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work 
 together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to 
 be replaced witha more compatible method. This feature explores how Factor 5

 I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents
 does not meet with your personal
 and business ethics, I apologize in advance.
 
 I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
 Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security
 advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
 person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 
 
 With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under
 the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
 severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last
 military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to
 the confines of his village.
 
 The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal
 that might be of interest to you. My
 client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a
 security company abroad. This fund
 came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's
 portfolio during his tenure
 as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that
 he had part of the funds transferred
 from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit
 with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
 security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could
 take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for
 himself as all his properties has been
 confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
 cannot travel out and effect the
 change of possession to his benefit.
 
 I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that
 can help him facilitate the
 change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for
 the execution of this endeavour are in
 my possession.
 
 The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred
 Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
 interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we
 can go 
 through the rudiments of this endeavour.

","  | Date: Fri, 19 Jul 2002 14:28:42 +0100
   | From: Niall O Broin <niall@linux.ie>
   | 
   | I have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk
   | to another.  However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it.
   | The problem is the bulk of the data is images and most of these
   | image have two directory entries i.e. there is a hard link to
   | each file.  If I copy them using cp -a or my usual favourite of
   | find .|cpio -pmd other_dir  it's going to copy each file twice,
   | which is not what I want. dump / restore would take care of this
   | if the source filesystem wasn't reiserfs  :-(  Any suggestions ?
 
  do your (and my) favourite, it'll be Ok:
 
   1. cpio(1) preserves hard links, i.e., if F1 and F2 are
      hard-linked and both are ""copied"", then the ""copies""
      are also hard-linked.  this is true of all `cpio's
      (and `tar' and any other decent/usable archival tool,
      by definition (IMHO)).
 
   2. `cpio -p' (at least `GNU cpio version 2.4.2') will only
      read/write (copy) the actual data bytes once.  I _think_
      this is true for all `cpio's (not just that GNU version),
      but am not certain.
 
  if you use an intermediate archive, e.g.:
 
     cpio -o ... >file;   ...;   cpio -i ... <file
 
  then the actual data bytes are copied into the archive (file)
  under each name (e.g., as both F1 and F2).  but GNU `cpio' is
  smart about this in pass-through mode (`-p'), copying the data
  just once (or so I read the source).
 
 cheers!
 	-blf-
 
 p.s. assuming this is a one-time operation that you won't repeat
     anytime soon (e.g., never; i.e., time isn't a major issue),
     and are not using any intermediate media/file (so storage
     isn't an issue), then even if `cpio' did read the data twice,
     so what? --- as long as, of course, it re-creates the hard
     links.  which it will.

 OK, so, you get the XML toss it through hardware and turn it back into a
 struct/object whatever you call your binary data. I agree this is the way
 things will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the
 application layer. So why turn it into XML in the first place? Becasue it
 gives geeks something to do and sells XML hardware accelerators and way more

 Yes, I am.  Everything is built inside a chroot.  I think it isn't linking 
 to a lib somewhere, I'm just not sure what lib it should preloading here.  
 Anyway to find out which one it is ?

 So thought I, but apparently all it favours is a lot of whining about good
 old times, the inability of youngn's to pay for your pension and the
 health insurance, and the generic influx of uncouth furriners, which must 
 be stopped, Somehow.

","Dear Sir / Madam
 
 If you are fed up of being 'ripped off' by the British government every time you buy your tobacco, then you should visit our website, where you can now buy 4 cartons of cigarettes, or 40 pouches of rolling tobacco from as little as 170 Euros (approx 105 pounds), inclusive of delivery by registered air mail from our office in Spain.  
 
 Why pay more???

 >>From the website:
 ""Spackle is designed to be a flexible client/server architecture for the 
 gathering and displaying of statistics, primarily suited to monitoring 
 servers. It's written in PHP and bash shell script, uses RRDtool  for stats 
 logging, and PostgreSQL for the server-side database. (soon to support MySQL 
 as well)""
 
 I had this up and running within a few hours. The hardest bit was getting 
 PostgreSQL running as it's been a few years since I used it. I had a bit of a 
 problem getting it to work on rh6.2 boxes but I documented the changes here: 
 http://xeer.blogspot.com/?/2002_07_01_xeer_archive.html#79148596
 
 Web interface is simple, but functional. It has a simple way of distributing 
 the monitoring scripts (which could be compromised but I digress), and the 
 resulting graphs are pretty!
 
 Donncha.

2399,"Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's
","Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated 
 with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
 the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
 related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
 hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
 obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
 G-Force Dyno-Staff.
 
 I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
 something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
 particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
 Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.
 
 To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
 seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
 religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
 irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
 contrast with our (my) modern mental models.
 
 I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
 justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

 We create the world we live in.
 A loving person lives in a loving world,
 A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
 Everyone you meet is your mirror.
 
 You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence 
 as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to 
 waste what you do have.
 
 The past is dead,
 The future is imaginary,
 Happiness can only be
 in the Eternal Now Moment
 
 How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 
 direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.
 
 Love a person because he or she is there.
 This is the only reason.
 
 Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 
 and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.
 
 The
 purpose
 of our lives
 is to be free
 of all addictive traps,

 Well, yeah, but there's an easier way.

 There's still MITM, but it requires a far higher capability, and is easier

 The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email<br>
 Saturday, July 20, 2002<p>
 <p>
 <b>Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Compute=
 r trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it migh=
 t be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
 </b>
 <p>
 Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by <a href=3D""http://clickth=
 ru.online.com/Click?q=3D14-5MRAIF-I438XVu98ZvQIzTKtR1dR"" >unveiling</a> new=
  iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
 <p>
 The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u=
 se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi=
 sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with=
  a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo=
 r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m=
 odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.
 <p>
 As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=
 itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=
 ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.
 <p>
 Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will =
 be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with =
 improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=
 he background photo as often as every 5 seconds.
 <p>
 But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch=
 eap upgrade when the company announced it will <a href=3D""http://clickthru.=
 online.com/Click?q=3D29-Sg_rIjM3xjSzf59NyGEI9rCM8vcR"" >not offer</a> a disc=
 ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr=
 ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h=
 ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=
 em for the retail price of $129.
 <p>
 Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=
 alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s=
 hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser=
 vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou=
 s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.
 <p>
 Apple also raised eyebrows by <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
 q=3D3e-F51nIizcfoh9HOq_7DQESNPe-iRR"" >transitioning</a> its iTools Web serv=
 ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t=
 o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service=
 s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=
  service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu=
 res.
 <p>
 Despite iTool's popularity, the company <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.=
 com/Click?q=3D53-n86dINniBiqIX-sjHpx8lOheMnlR"" >may face a tough sell</a> w=
 ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=
 . Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =
 free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=
  free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to=
  form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=
 .
 <p>
 To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=
  services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz=
 ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,=
  an <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D68-iM8qIsPWu8FuzAvywvj=
 sK-FdLP4R"" >online petition</a> protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel=
 l for the program.
 <p>
 <b><font color=3D""#CC0000"">Microsoft's moves</font></b><br>
 Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to <a href=3D""http=
 ://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D7d-FFEqIDLWMEqg-q9Uywq2NRJSBTeR"" >offer a=
  rebate</a> for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software=
  bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=
 bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for=
  those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.
 <p>
 The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=
 t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=
  copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =
 program went on sale last November.
 <p>
 Microsoft is also putting the <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
 q=3D93-V4PmQSdrF0o9nH2cTYjvQ8Rgn5FR"" >finishing touches</a> on the third co=
 llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=
  a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c=
 ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=
 perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co=
 uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=
 ixes are available as separate downloads.
 <p>
 
 Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro=
 soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has <a href=3D""http://clickt=
 hru.online.com/Click?q=3Da8-02XZQQZDjZijEBtDtZs6swzdON9R"" >shut down</a> a =
 site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T=
 he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java =
 inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the=
  forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.
 <p>
 <b><font color=3D""#CC0000"">Somebody's watching you</font></b><br>
 
 You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah=
 oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter=
  to <a href=3D""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Dbd-c0nUQ7pV9moRKw2pAEV=
 gnfqGsJuR"" >swap out</a> a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that=
  pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
 <p>
 The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contai=
 n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS=
 cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=
  to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =
 example.
 <p>
 ""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced =
 e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will =
 open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=
 nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =
 line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'=
 s knowledge.
 <p>
 
 On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g=
 overnment is again turning to technology to <a href=3D""http://clickthru.onl=
 ine.com/Click?q=3Dd2-THo_QULs_DzX3rh3Gl22vbAOyesR"" >monitor suspicious acti=
 vity</a> in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor=
 e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan=
  to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =
 suspicious behavior.
 <p>
 ""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail=
 y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=
  or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. =
 But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,=
  fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=
 ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

 HI ,  
 
 As a professional bulk mailer for 5 years. I made over $200,000 last 12 months selling only one product, ""The Banned CD"".
 
 Luckily for you, the 'Bulker CD 2003"" is now for sale! I decide to sell all secrets how I made over $20,000 per month at home only few hours work.
 
 Why don't more people use Bulk Email Marketing?
 
 1. Lack of knowledge. Most people do not know how to set up a marketing campaign let alone set up an effective email marketing campaign. Through hard work and trial and error, we have developed simple yet successful strategies to send your emails. We can show you how to do it properly.
 2. Fear of getting into trouble. Most people do not send email because they have heard negative things about SPAM and that your isp will shut you down. This is true if you don't know what you are doing and bulk email to the masses. If you don't believe in SPAM, we have developed alternative ways to bulk email so that you are sending your emails responsibly without getting into any trouble at all.
 3. Don't have the necessary equipment/softwares. To send your emails out, you need a computer with specialized email software installed that will send or harvest your emails.

 In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
 ""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
 part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  
 
 For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
 serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
 West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
 protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
 heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
 local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
 I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
 facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
 protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
 results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
 and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
 to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
 effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
 protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

","Don't know if everybody knows this trick...
 
 Puts 127.0.0.1 as the IP for adservers. Elegant.
 
 ==
 
 http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.html
 
 As mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat
 when it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective
 methods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to
 resolve domain names and IP addresses. If you're running windows, you
 already have a hosts file but it most likely isn't being used.
 
 What a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get
 rid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with
 the IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the
 listed domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this
 case is your own computer. What happens is that it won't display the ad. If
 you choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out
 links. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism.
 
 You can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows
 directory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you
 do. The hosts file is called ""hosts"" there is no extension. You may have a
 file named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file.
 
 Once you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your
 computer and it's a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at
 the contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as
 an address for getting updated versions. <http://www.accs-net.com/hosts/>
 
 Because we're inherently lazy, this works for windows only, don't use it on
 a mac! Follow the address in the hosts file for alternative system

 Thanks!
 
 In the past I tried ""lilo -u /dev/hda"" and it wouldn't work -- an
 original copy of the MBR must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
 Which is exactly what I didn't have.  The installation of Linux
 Mandrake didn't afford me that luxury.
 
 Also, I'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --
 previously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
 This is obviously not the case.

 You could go the same way as the others and call it gkrellm2 and

 THE ISO17799 NEWSLETTER - EDITION 4
 ______________________________________________________
 
 Welcome to the fourth edition of the ISO17799 newsletter, designed to
 keep you abreast of news and developments with respect to ISO17799 and
 information security. 
 
 The information contained in this newsletter is absolutely free to our
 subscribers and provides guidance on various practical issues, plus
 commentary on recent Information Security incidents. 
 
 Guidance and information included in this issue:
 
 1)  The ISO17799 Toolkit Uncovered 
 2)  Social Engineering - Are you Susceptible?
 3)  ISO17799: A World Wide Phenomena
 4)  Stranger Danger
 5)  ISO17700: More Frequently Asked Questions
 6)  Credit Card Transactions - Minimize the Risks
 7)  BSI Certifications - Congratulations
 8)  ISO17799 Section 11 - BCP Review
 9)  It Couldn't Happen Here.... Could It?
 10)  Subscription Information
 
 
 
 THE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
 ==============================
 
 The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
 an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But
 why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  
 
 The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
 start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
 itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
 quickly.
 
 The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
 organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
 embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
 critical steps to compliance.
 
 In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
 describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
 Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
 of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
 parts).
 
 In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
 a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
 section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
 help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).
 
 It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
 set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
 newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
 of terms.  
 
 Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
 in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
 ISO17799, it can be invaluable. 
 
 More information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be
 found at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.com
 
 The standard itself can alternatively be procured from:  
 http://www.iso17799.net 
 
 
 
 SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
 =========================================
 
 The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
 based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
 IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.
 
 Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
 has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
 target even realizing that they have parted with it.
 
 The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
 for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
 is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  
 
 The following are some of the major techniques employed:
 
 BAITING
 This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
 leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
 conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
 legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.
 
 PULLING RANK
 This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
 company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
 not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
 assumed. 
 
 EXHAUSTING
 This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
 the target.
 
 SURF BOARDING
 Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
 confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
 doorway, etc.
 
 SURVEYS
 The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
 a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
 purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
 sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.
 
 
 There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
 prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. 
 
 Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:
 
 a) the sensitivity of the information
 b) your authority to exchange or release the information
 c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
 d) the purpose of the exchange
 
 The act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.
 
 
 
 ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA =================================
 
 Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
 take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
 embracing it with enthusiasm.
 
 To illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
 table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
 Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
 serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
 purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
 others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
 position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
 substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
 500 from the download location.
 
 That aside, the table makes interesting reading:

 STRANGER DANGER
 ===============
 
 As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
 items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
 you deal with them every day... but now look again.
 
 If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
 What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
 passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
 you see?
 
 The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
 want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
 the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
 visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. 
 
 This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
 but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
 due caution is not exercised.
 
 The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
 minimized:
 
 * Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
 that visitors wear them
 
 * Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.
 
 * Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges
 
 * If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours
 
 * Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
 are doing
 
 * Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
 don't let them make their way to you
 
 * Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID
 
 * Do not leave visitors alone   
 
 
 
 ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
 ==========================================
 
 1) How many controls are there in the standard?
 Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
 over 500 detailed controls in total.
 
 2) What is part 2?
 Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
 build and operate an information security management system.
 
 3) How old is it?
 The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
 the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.
 
 4) What is accreditation?
 An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
 under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
 different countries.
 
 5) Is certification for life?
 No. It is normally for three year periods.
 
 6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
 created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
 representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
 Norway, UK and USA, amongst others.
 
 7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
 No. It is generic in terms of legislation.
 
 
 
 CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
 ============================================
 
 The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
 become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
 associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
 especially when making payments over the Internet.  
 
 Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
 and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
 criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
 which can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively
 simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
 to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
 from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
 (http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
 ""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
 year.  
 
 We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
 risks involved in credit card transactions:
 
 * Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
 Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
 have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
 purchases.
 
 * All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
 carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.
 
 * Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
 to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
 (as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
 secure connection.
 
 * If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
 information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be
 extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
 the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
 that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
 security!
 
 * If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
 talking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the
 organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
 pay by some other means.
 
 * Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
 transactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
 organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.

 ISO17799 SECTION 11: BCP REVIEW 
 ===============================
 
 Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
 core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
 continuity plan.
 
 Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
 This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
 these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
 expensive, etc.
 
 Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
 organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
 task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
 MS-Word: The BCP Generator.
 
 This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
 planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
 interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
 the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
 continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
 largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
 active use in over 40 countries.
   
 With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
 there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
 lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
 they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
 need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
 diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.
 
 For information on the BCP Generator see:

 IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?
 ====================================
 
 Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
 of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
 issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:
 
 
 1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
 US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
 security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
 dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
 interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
 security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
 outside until just after normal trading time.
 
 He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
 electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. 
 
 The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
 incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
 to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.
 
 He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
 simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
 the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
 loss!
 
 
 2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
 controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
 company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
 (which had never been changed!). 
 
 This gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for
 himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
 user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
 with the dial back system.
 
 Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
 computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
 of evenings.
 
 To recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
 computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
 cost.
 
 
 3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
 within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
 critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
 its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
 parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
 started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
 spiral. 
 
 Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
 the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
 staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
 and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
 short circuit.
 
 When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
 overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
 delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
 company lost at least 500,000 UKP.

 I dunno if I'd accuse everybody who believes the 3K number of needing a

 there's a lot of people who need more lovin.  Plus it fits in with a bunch

7012,"Subject: [Razor-users] Re: turning off checksums per MIME part
","  The way Razor breaks down mail is simple.  If a mail contains MIME
   boundaries it is split on those boundaries, each MIME part is considered 
   when marking the mail as spam.
   
   In 2.14, there are different 'logic methods' for detecting spam.
   The default method 5 requires all non-contention parts to be spam for
   the mail to be marked as spam.  A part is considered under
   contention if its not clear if its spam are not, and is relatively
   rare.
 
   Sounds like you are not using 2.14, or maybe you're misinterpreting
   the log files.  Feel free to send me the log files if you think 
   there is a bug.
 
   Also, as jordan says, if you get a legit mail marked as spam (based

   all parts in) so TeS can take care of business.

","draw the pain
 
 ""Ken never wrote about this method, but he often demonstrated it in
 workshops. Let us say you have a physical pain somewhere in your body. You
 draw the pain in the air with your finger, about 30 cm (1 foot) high. Take
 about 60 seconds to trace around the perimeter of the pain, carefully
 listening to the pain to find the precise boundary between where it hurts
 and where it does not. Repeat. You will find that after about 10 minutes of
 this the pain will shift, shrink or disappear. A variant of this is to
 imagine making a 3D model the pain in coloured clay.""
 
 Works!  There's this coworker - a real pain in my ass!  I used my middle
 finger to trace his outline for about 60 seconds.  I listened to him, found
 the boundary, and repeated the motion.  He left my office!

 Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's
 
 
 Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated
 with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be
 the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but
 related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"",
 hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I
 obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /
 G-Force Dyno-Staff.
 
 I have to say however that, having found this while looking for
 something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I
 particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the
 Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.
 
 To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular
 seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some
 religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very
 irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and
 contrast with our (my) modern mental models.
 
 I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and
 justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

 We create the world we live in.
 A loving person lives in a loving world,
 A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
 Everyone you meet is your mirror.
 
 You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence
 as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to
 waste what you do have.
 
 The past is dead,
 The future is imaginary,
 Happiness can only be
 in the Eternal Now Moment
 
 How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the
 direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.
 
 Love a person because he or she is there.
 This is the only reason.
 
 Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions
 and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.
 
 The
 purpose
 of our lives
 is to be free
 of all addictive traps,
 and thus
 become one
 with the ocean of
 Living Love.

","> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have

 An interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there's no written 
 evidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the 
 infamous quote attributed to him. It's kind of astounding that there is 
 enough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* 
 FAQ) and ""eyewitness"" reporting without a single written source. What 
 the essay below doesn't seem to answer, though, is what the earliest 
 attributed quote in print by any other writer is. I'd naturally be much 
 more skeptical if the ""quote"" emerged after his death... RK
 
 ===============================================================
 http://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm
 
 ""A billion here, a billion there . . .""
 
 Did Dirksen ever say, "" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon 
 you're talking real money""? (or anything very close to that?)
 
 Perhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio 
 records of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found 
 no evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to 
 him.
 
 Archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics 
 showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote 
 or its variations.
 
 Here is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed 
 ""Ev and Charlie"" and ""Ev and Jerry"" shows, all newspapers clippings in 
 the Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen's own speech notes, 
 transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of 
 Republican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen's statements on the 
 Senate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.
 
 Although Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to 
 rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular 
 turn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or 
 excessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word ""pothole"" to 
 remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to 
 the debt ceiling:
 
 
 ""As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make 
 the deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were 
 working on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got 
 through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to 
 the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic 
 hazard.
 
 ""Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a 
 conference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and 
 said, I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth 
 and remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.'"" 
 [Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].
 
 
 On the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another ""spending"" story, 
 one he labeled ""cat in the well"":
 
 
 ""One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story 
 about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, Johnny, a cat 
 fell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and 
 then fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the 
 well?'
 
 ""Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a 
 while, and then when the teacher came down and said, How are you 
 getting along?' Johnny said, Teacher, if you give me another slate and 
 a couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes 
 I can land that cat in hell.'
 
 ""If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do 
 not find much to cheer about concerning it."" [Congressional Record, June 
 16, 1965, p. 13884].
 
 
 But there are no such reminders for the ""A billion here, a billion 
 there . . . "" tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen's 
 note-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt 
 ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no 
 authoritative reference to the ""billion"" phrase.
 
 The chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from 
 people who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for 
 example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as 
 evidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard 
 Dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But 
 cross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up 
 nothing in the way of confirmation.
 
 The closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican 
 leadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, ""The 
 favorite sum of money is $1 billion  a billion a year for a fatter 
 federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there."" [EMD Papers, 
 Republican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the ""and pretty 
 soon you're talking real money"" is missing.
 
 In another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted 
 Dirksen: ""Look at education  two-and-one-half billion  a billion for 
 this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five 
 billion for public works. You haven't got any budget balance left. 
 You'll be deeply in the red."" [Cited in Byron Hulsey's ""Everett Dirksen 
 and the Modern Presidents,"" Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of 
 Texas, p. 226]
 
 Of course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late 
 Senator's comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not 
 have his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional 
 Records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen's life and 
 career  he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses 
 claim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen's campaign speeches 
 tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated 
 newspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, 
 meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped 
 capture.
 
 Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have 
 endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he 
 ever coined it.

 FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION,
 
 RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.
 
 I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents
 does not meet with your personal
 and business ethics, I apologize in advance.
 
 I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
 Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security
 advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the
 person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 
 
 With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under
 the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under
 severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last
 military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to
 the confines of his village.
 
 The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal
 that might be of interest to you. My
 client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a
 security company abroad. This fund
 came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's
 portfolio during his tenure
 as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that
 he had part of the funds transferred
 from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit
 with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal
 security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could
 take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for
 himself as all his properties has been
 confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
 cannot travel out and effect the
 change of possession to his benefit.
 
 I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that
 can help him facilitate the
 change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for
 the execution of this endeavour are in
 my possession.
 
 The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred
 Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
 interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we
 can go 
 through the rudiments of this endeavour.
 
 I remain most obliged.

 And maybe because there isn't an official 2.40 yet. It's 2.40-cvs and 
 changes from day to day. Or, to cite the page [1]: ""these are built nightly

 Oh yeah, I was following this thread in the sylpheed-claws list.  Very
 interesting stuff.  I might have to stick w/ 0.8.2 until aspell gets
 updated in Red Hat.

 And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually 
 quite funny .. if DMA was enabled for the CD-ROM *and* you tried to access 
 a CD with Joliet extensions. Otherwise it worked just fine with DMA 
 enabled :)

 Making a mesh on the move
 
 A new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
 reports Peter Rojas
 
 Peter Rojas
 Thursday August 29, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
 anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
 for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
 download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.
 
 This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
 third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
 years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
 technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
 sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
 dream.
 
 Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
 are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
 Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
 with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
 ""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
 proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
 network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
 traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
 reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
 antennas, and improving wireless coverage.
 
 As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
 other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
 networking may be inevitable.
 
 Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
 networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
 connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
 dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
 speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
 technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
 wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
 protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
 faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.
 
 The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
 much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
 problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
 Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
 because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
 connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
 connection.
 
 Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
 to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
 cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
 that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
 100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
 proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
 software.
 
 It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
 Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
 is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
 pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
 acquiring 3G licences.
 
 All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
 to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
 better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
 networks.
 
 But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
 high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
 and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
 music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
 UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.
 
 At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
 person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
 Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
 their favourite songs, movies, and video games.
 
 But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
 MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
 Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
 that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
 employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
 cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
 enterprise networks.
 
 The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
 incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
 high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.
 
 When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
 your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
 was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
 someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

 One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many 
 kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
 influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
 learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
 two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
 own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
 wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
 individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
 on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
 come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
 that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
 big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
 the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
 efficiently for how their kids are taught.

7664,"Subject: Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four
","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 
 
 *""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
 from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
 couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
 one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
 of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
 back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
 messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
 fail is not insignificant. 
 
 Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
 after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
 prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 
 
 [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
 Screenshot)] 
 
 The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
 predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
 not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
 Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
 didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
 so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
 long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
 you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
 of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
 their system in an indeterminate state. 
 
 In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
 in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
 the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 
 
 And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
 upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
 reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
 keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
 part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
 would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
 don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
 code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
 call it at the right place. 
 
 I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
 do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
 slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
 FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
 operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
 the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
 IIS to stop and start. 
 
 *""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
 has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
 your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
 to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
 arguments are unbelievably boring.  
 
 Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
 since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
 I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
 well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
 definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
 certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
 in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
 an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
 is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
 search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
 find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
 know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
 Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
 costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
 productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
 code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
 I've been using for years to make wizards. 
 
 *""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
 programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
 made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 
 
 - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
 life of the code. 
 - Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
 them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
 because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
 SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
 new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
 morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
 the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
 Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
 suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
 too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
 lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
 - Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
 standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
 oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
 meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
 mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
 software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
 guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
 and say ""Aha!""
 
 
 *""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
 Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
 reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

 I don't know a lot about ALSA, but use custom kernels for many of the 
 machines -- would this mean, in order to get mplayer (eg) to work, I'd 
 first have to compile a custom kernel option? or kernel module? Since I 
 wouldn't have your alsa-kernel(??) installed, would that mean alsa-libs 
 and so on won't install?
 
 (I guess, in short, if it *requires* the shipped kernel to be used, I'd

 Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem. 
 
 I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They both
 display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home
 box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
 I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
 carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.
 
 That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
 place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
 exmh working on the same set of folders.
 
 It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
 so bad that I can't stand it.

 _Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be 
 rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. 
 
 If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to 
 design a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might 
 look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: 
 
 - It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify 
 required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown 
 number of parsers around the world. 
 - It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, 
 thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. 
 - It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such 
 egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an 
 obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. 
 - Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core 
 namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely 
 resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. 
 - After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its 
 add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the 
 spec would neither define nor elaborate on. 
 - After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements 
 semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also 
 fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the 
 same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers 
 and inconsistent behavior across consumers. 
 
 RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. 
 For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's 
 pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication 
 format, we have the worst one possible. 
 
 Except, of course, for all the others. 
 
 The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of 
 necessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format 
 has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very 
 weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it 
 possible in the first place. 
 
 - Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened 
 up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. 
 - Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing 
 content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce 
 valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social 
 mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally 
 introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable 
 display through unclosed HTML elements. 
 - Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't 
 matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages 
 where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes 
 and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out 
 in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more 
 flexibility. 
 
 Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious 
 computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type 
 Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made 
 it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this 
 ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts 
 over the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the 
 year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: 
 
 - Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which 
 fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. 
 - Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at 
 the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years 
 later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with 
 parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF 
 parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version 
 is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) 
 Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts 
 recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to 
 actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise 
 of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 
 feed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the 
 world&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets 
 into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. 
 - Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been 
 haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be 
 flourishing. 
 
 Evolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a 
 thousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to 
 their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. 
 
 - Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. 
 My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a 
 TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know 
 nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is 
 littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. 
 If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would 
 be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such 
 perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. 
 There is no middle ground. 
 - What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to 
 earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, 
 they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long 
 descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such 
 practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle 
 them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it 
 faces. 
 - Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie 
 Orgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list 
 of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with 
 any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 
 0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 
 &#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is 
 missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central 
 group can design a better system in the long haul. 
 
 Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable 
 formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect 
 syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. 
 Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, 
 partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.

 So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for

 The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of

 SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
 BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)
 
 Dear Sir, 
 
 I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
 Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
 Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
 this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
 of both of us. 
 
 The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
 lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
 late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
 money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
 personal belongings and as such the security company does 
 not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
 originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
 Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
 with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
 before he died of cardiac arrest.
 
 As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
 an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
 consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
 affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
 to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
 consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
 and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
 Terrorist fund.
  
 If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
 me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
 expenses, and 75% for us.
 
 You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
 name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
 that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
 also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
 of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
 consignment.
 
 Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
 communication
  
 Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
 requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
 (seven) working days.
 
 I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
 my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
 mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 
 
 Best regards, 
 Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

 Secure and at ease
 ByJack Mccarthy
 August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PT
 
 MAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
 in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
 where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
 late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
 co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
 of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
 transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
 company for a king's ransom.
 
 Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.
 
 A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
 Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
 mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
 passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
 PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
 company.
 
 ""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
 says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""
 
 Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
 focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
 fortune.
 
 ""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
 processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
 it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
 The trade-off is fundamental.""
 
 Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
 e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
 accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
 service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
 more than 3 million business accounts.
 
 Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
 PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
 Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
 companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
 of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.
 
 Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
 areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""
 
 Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
 ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
 participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.
 
 ""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
 one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
 Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20
 
 PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
 Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
 exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
 covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.
 
 ""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
 susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
 Litan says.
 
 To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
 that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
 says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
 work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
 work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
 arrived.""

 I don't think a ballistic missile defense system will be much help
 against a rock a couple thousand kilometers in diameter.  That's WAY
 outside the design spec for any such system.  Particularly when
 ballistic intercept designs usually don't have any type of warhead
 associated with them, either being kinetic or directed energy weapons.
 
 Contrary to popular belief, ballistic missile defense isn't a hard
 problem (ignoring whether or not it is useful).  The only real challenge
 is materials science, as it really pushes the envelope of materials
 performance requirements to places they've never been; there has been
 some technology crossover with some of the new materials and processes
 they've had to come up with.  The actual discrimination algorithms,
 while way more advanced than anything you'll see in the private sector
 (and classified, to keep it that way), are usually run on a crusty old
 MIPS R3k embedded processor or similar, with a low-to-mid range DSP to
 help out. It is not computationally intensive by any means.
 
 I used to be tangentially involved in various ballistic missile
 intercept weapon programs many years ago and am pretty familiar with the
 technologies that go into them.  Most of the arguments against it from a
 technological standpoint are ignorant bullshit, and have lead me to
 believe that hardly anyone understands the technical parameters of
 ballistic missile intercept.  And the arguments that are made without
 reference to the capability of the technology are neither particularly
 convincing nor conclusive.
 
 In summary:
 
 1) Ballistic missile intercept technology is useless on a big rock.  You
 are much better off using heavy-lift space technology to deliver a big
 nuke (or small nuke, depending on your plan). 
 
 2) State-of-the-art ballistic missile intercept technology is far more
 competent than most people imagine it is, and has discrimination
 capabilities that exceed most popular belief.  It better be -- they've
 had twenty years to work on it.
 
 3) I've never heard a really convincing argument against deploying
 ballistic missile intercept technology, particularly considering most of
 the R&D investment has already been made. I don't really care about it
 one way or the other, but I also don't see why other people have fits
 over it either.
 
 Cheers,

1320,"Subject: Priceless
","URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443744
 Date: Not supplied
 
 I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
 excerpt was rather amusing.
 
 _It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
 browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
 browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
 window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
 Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
 MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
 Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
 [for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
 fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
 _
 Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
 ""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
 browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
 because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" 
 
 Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
 downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
 was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
 browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
 browser that embedded WinIE. 
 
 MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
 prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
 a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
 context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
 definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
 capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
 the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 
 
 I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
 weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
 encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
 would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
 single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.
 
 The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
 much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
 overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
 Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
 browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
 didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
 nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
 continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
 that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
 of it.
 
 Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
 Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
 now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
 twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 
 
 Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
 should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
 off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
 Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.

 SEC EXPOSES BIG BLUE'S PINK SLIPS
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass
 yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day
 of the deadline for companies to certify their financial
 statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited
 for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words
 tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave 
 the commission its latest layoff numbers.
 
 IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings
 report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope.
 (""Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way..."") Only after
 ""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit
 that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's
 about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. 
 An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher
 number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than expected 
 taking voluntary layoffs. 
 
 Sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" Did IBM ""rightsize""
 last quarter, too?
 
 IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some
 details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's
 microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT
 services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees 
 from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.)
 Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such
 as Austin and Raleigh. 
 
 OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're
 still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so
 bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting
 regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for ""stealth
 layoffs,"" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced
 it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the
 latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give
 specifics. Yeesh. - Jen Muehlbauer

 SYNERGY AND BETRAYAL AT VIVENDI
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top
 man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced
 today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle 
 up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book
 publisher Houghton Mifflin. 
 
 It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine
 turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply
 following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe
 $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian
 reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when
 investors got the willies about the company's impending
 announcement on its financial health. But the company had
 positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first 
 half was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7%
 boost. 
 
 Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring
 efforts, with more information expected at the next board
 meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton
 Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague
 explanation that included the ""Curious George"" character, were
 the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian
 speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games
 business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone
 company SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates,
 according to the newspaper. 
 
 Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues
 to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources
 say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough
 to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan
 abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an
 unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the
 Mediterranean. The working title? ""How I Was Betrayed.""  -

 					<P>Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day of the deadline for companies to certify their financial statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave the commission its latest layoff numbers.</P><P>
 IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (""Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way..."") Only after ""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than
 expected taking voluntary layoffs. </P><P>
 Sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" Did IBM ""rightsize"" last quarter, too?</P><P>
 IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.) Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such as Austin and Raleigh. </P><P>
 OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for ""stealth layoffs,"" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give specifics. Yeesh. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

 					<P>Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book publisher Houghton Mifflin. </P><P>
 It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe $18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when investors got the willies about the company's impending announcement on its financial health. But the company had positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first half was 
 up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7% boost. </P><P>
 Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring efforts, with more information expected at the next board meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague explanation that included the ""Curious George"" character, were the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone company SFR, a debatable
 sale because of the cash it generates, according to the newspaper. </P><P>
 Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the Mediterranean. The working title? ""How I Was Betrayed.""  - Deborah Asbrand </P><P>

 I'm not sure which way to make
 the old bits call on this:
 
 [A] <http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-September/014448.html>
 was posted well after
 [B] <http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-August/014351.html>
 was in the archives, but then
 again, [B] didn't bother with
 any commentary (new bits).
 
 If you two can agree upon who
 was at fault, penance will be
 to explain how feedback phase
 is affected by time lags, and
 tie that in to the spontaneous
 generation of ""business cycles""
 in the Beer Game. *

","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020925.html

 Eddie Kessler describes programming at Napster[1]. 
 
 Ray Ozzie has more on platforms[2]. ""Finding the 'right' price point for a 
 software platform is critical."" To me this sounds like a fancy way of saying, 
 ""I groove all that stuff about how platforms need to be cheap and ubiquitous, 
 but I can't bring myself to do it."" The price, Ray says, ""must be high enough 
 both 1) to maintain a perception of value in the platform, and 2) to create 
 significant margins well before ubiquity is assured so that the ecosystem is 
 assured of the platform's ultimate viability."" What he doesn't mention: if you 
 lower the price on the only product you're selling, you have a revenue hit, 
 which will not make your investors happy, and you may run out of money and have 
 to close. But that must be what he's thinking.

 I guess that requires something more in the way of budget then...  Given
 that this monitor was serving as the single monitor for 4 boxen (via a
 4-way vga KVM switch), I'd be looking at investing in 4 DVI cards along
 with another KVM to suit while a VGA version _should_ just plug into
 place.

 We're currently using a perceptron classifier. It *can't* learn
 combinations of rules.[1]
 
 I gave an example, assume 4 rules:
    SPAM = (A or B) and (C or D)
 
 It cannot learn that function.
 
 A decision tree classifier *can* learn that example, and the function
 above, where a .5 S/O rule is only important in certain
 circumstances. (Then again, it may be smartest to hardcode a meta-rule
 for that case, rather than trust to a naive DT learner.)

 In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
 you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
 will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
 just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
 reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?
 
 With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
 the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
 this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
 change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
 will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
 precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).

 After sending the report I started fiddling with the Ftoc_RescanLine 
 stuff and I havn't seen it since. I can't really tell if it was my 
 hacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic 
 happening since this was the first invocation of that version of 
 exmh. I've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens 
 again.
 
 
 On another thing with the Ftoc_RescanLine stuff. This routine is 
 called at times still unclar to me. An inspection of the routine 
 suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form 
 ""current"" state to re-paint the ftoc line. However, checking the 
 msg.tcl code (MSgChange) we find:
 
     if {$msgid != {}} {
         # Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line 
 instead
         if {$msgid < 0}  return
     } else {
         # line null too, try using first in folder
         if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 }
         set msgid [Ftoc_MsgNumber [Ftoc_FindMsg $msgid $line]]
     }
     Ftoc_ClearCurrent
     Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msgid
     Ftoc_ShowSequences $exmh(folder)
 
 The Ftoc_ClearCurrent calls Ftoc_RescanLIne to clear the '+' sign 
 _before_ the on-disk transition is made. I hacked this stuff and more 
 or less changed the order. It works, but fails on some folder changes.
 
 My feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a 
 Ftoc_ClearCurrent, but rather just a RescanLine and the caller had 
 better know the line or msgid. That routine shoud just put in the '+' 
 if the line/msg in question happened to be the cur msg. Thoughts?

 This is the way forward, IMO.  Just wait a couple of years until
 66 million Muslim Turks are making great strides towards democracy
 and prosperity in the E.U. and Syria, Lebanon etc start lining up and
 making similar decisions.
 
 Of course there are hard-liners who would be right at home on

 ""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.

 The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) 
 Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 
 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** 
 (Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) 
 **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** 
 (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
 Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and 
 the same could be said for DOM. 
 **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
 **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** 
 (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** 
 (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) 
 Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the 
 owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** 
 Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made 
 possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. 
 **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

 June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. 
 ""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" 
 http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. 
 The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

 June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: 
 **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** 
 Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the 
 northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. 
 The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" 
 **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. 
 The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** 
 Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios 
 succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. 
 The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

 June 1, 1999: News Release
 Part One Background: 
 On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": 
 This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
 The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: » » exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). 
 » » was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, 
 Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. 
 » » was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution 
 of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. » » has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek » » has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as 
 - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
 boundaries."" 
 » » exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and 
 matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. » » has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political 
 jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
 Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: 
 » » also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo 
 Convention (1933). 
 » » was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, 
 which included the United States, China and the USSR. » » was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. » » has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. » » has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. » » exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. » » has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of 
 EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. 
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. 
 Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: 
 ""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

 News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
 Part Two Background: 
 The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC, February 1999, states as follows: 
 ""Where Are OFCs Located? 
 [Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. 
 The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
 Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less. For further information and links to documents, see: EnenKio Documents http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/ml_intro.html http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/index.html March 16, 1999: News Release 
 The impact of the passing on December 10 of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, First Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak Atolls of the Marshall Islands, beloved husband and father, was felt throughout the society.  Flags were flown at half mast for a week 
 in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the world.  His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the highest ranking chiefs, according to Marshallese custom.   His Majesty King Remios Hermios 
 Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.  His 
 Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information, contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE 
 March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.  The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.  The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.  Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.  It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.  While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.  Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.  The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. 
 While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.  The refusal of 
 the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.  Your understanding is appreciated.

 December 19, 1998: News Release 
 Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio 
 The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace.

 July 14, 1998: Communiqué to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. 
 The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'être is clearly mandated in the Preamble to 
 the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org 
 Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. 
 The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers.

 May 4, 1997: News Release 
 Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps 
 The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. 
 BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. 
 A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. 
 ""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. 
 CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

 March 31, 1997: News Release 
 An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. 
 This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. 
 The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. 
 However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. 
 Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: » » ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable 
 accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". » » ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" 
 » » ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
 every 
 action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" 
 » » ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior » » ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" » » That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". 
 The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

 February 6, 1995: News Release 
 On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 
 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. 
 An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. 
 On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. 
 Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. 
 Request for Media Response: 
 The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 
 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 
 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 
 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 
 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 
 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 
 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) 
 Parting Shot: 
 What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.

 November 21, 1994: News Release 
 In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. 
 The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. 
 While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. 
 Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. 
 Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: » » Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. 
 » » In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed 
 Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. » » Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. » » A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land.

 Most spammers don't check reply codes at all, they just send out as many
 mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.
 
 A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
 some time ago: answer all incoming mail with a 4xx temporary error code when
 it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
 mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.

 As I mentioned in my email to Anders, it's certainly in my code and I don't 
 have time to work on it right now, so I would not be offended if you worked on 
 it.
 
 I just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be 
 done before my vacation that will require my efforts, so it's even more true 
 that it was when I sent the mail to Anders.

 Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo
 Posted by Dan Gillmor
 
 
 Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's
 Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a
 DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with
 different regional codes.
 
 Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital
 Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological
 methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.
 And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to
 ask him not to do the demonstration.
 
 HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was
 willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried
 that it would be ""a more juicy target,"" the kind of deep pockets that
 might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's
 understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would
 take a stand on the right side of this issue.
 
 So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on
 things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A
 shame, but that's how things are going these days.
 
 Hollywood is winning, folks. You are losing. And you'd better start caring

 family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
 called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to
 send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This
 worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
 are not affected.

 <font size=""-1""> The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
 screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
 attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
 known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of
 a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,
 this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.

 <P>
 No. Many new viruses do not require a PC-based e-mail client such
 as Outlook in order to spread. These new viruses, including 
 Klez, have their own e-mail client (SMTP) and can find e-mail
 addresses within cached Web pages on an infected machine,
 bypassing the need to use Outlook's Address Book. Larger
 Web-based e-mail services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, screen
 mail hosted on their sites for viruses, but there's no beating
 having a good antivirus product on your desktop just in case.

       Cisco Aironet 1200 Series - Absolute freedom, maximum security.
 
       Dear Mr. Winder
 
            See how you can have the highest level of security and mobility
 with our free CD-ROM on the Cisco Aironet 1200 Series of Wireless LAN (WLAN)
 solutions.
 
       The modular, dual-band design supports either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz
 wireless frequencies, or both simultaneously.  It integrates easily with
 existing wired networks and is hardware and software upgradeable.  This
 preserves existing investments, so you will be able to advance into the
 future with IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g standards without having to replace
 your entire WLAN infrastructure.
 
       Rest assured, the Cisco Aironet 1200 Series is as secure as a wired
 network.  Corporate data is protected by the award-winning Cisco Wireless
 Security Suite.  It's scalable, centrally managed 802.1x architecture
 provides both secure authentication as well as data transmission through
 per-user, per session generation and distribution of 128-bit encryption
 keys.
 
       Click here for your free CD-ROM or to request a Cisco representative
 contact you.
 
       Cisco Aironet 1200 Series WLAN solution - Maximum security, absolute
 freedom.
 
       Yours Sincerely,
 
       Tony Wright
       Regional Manager - Marketing

 As game developers reach for new forms of gameplay and a better process for 
 implementing established genres, the wisdom of licensing physics engines is 
 becoming inescapable. Physics engines do more than just knock over boxes, 
 however, and the interface between your game and a physics engine must be 
 fairly complex in order to harness advanced functionality.

 This I would guess is normal, but don't you get it at the very beginning of
 the build? Isn't this at the end just a reminder?

 Argh, I forgot to exclude aaxine from the %files when using ""--without

 The current ""fr6.1"" spec file fixes this...

1135,"Subject: Sun Nabs Storage Startup - buys Pirus Networks
","
 Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?
 
 ==
 http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271
 
 Sun Nabs Storage Startup
 By Clint Boulton
 Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
 Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
 storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.
 
 The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
 with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
 virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
 virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
 into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
 is managed from a central console.
 
 Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
 of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
 scouting some 65 companies.
 
 Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
 that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
 acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
 storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
 as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.
 
 ""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
 or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
 critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""
 
 N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
 architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
 role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
 as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
 networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.
 
 While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
 in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
 according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
 IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
 increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
 respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
 $411 million.
 
 Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
 Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.

 argh, they do not, do they?   the FPs must be just gigantic :(

 Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
 a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
 a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.
 
 Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
 but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
 correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.

 %description
     SpamAssassin provides you with a way to reduce if not completely
 eliminate
     Unsolicited Commercial Email (SPAM) from your incoming email.  It can
     be invoked by a MDA such as sendmail or postfix, or can be called from
     a procmail script, .forward file, etc.  It uses a genetic-algorithm
     evolved scoring system to identify messages which look spammy, then
     adds headers to the message so they can be filtered by the user's mail
     reading software.  This distribution includes the spamd/spamc components
     which create a server that considerably speeds processing of mail.

 http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html
 
 ""Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run
 on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be
 run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.
 Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field
 started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI
 and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to
 go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the
 client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one
 important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is
 loaded, as JavaScript functions do.
 
 And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access
 XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their
 browser.""
 
 ===
 ""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a
 new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured
 out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and
 billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of
 servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai
 does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default
 ""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house
 applications.""
 
 ""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
 Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is
 more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth
 connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several
 cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
 these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
 the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
 digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header
 for the file.""

   Japanese Crime Noir in DivX Video
   ---------------------------------
 
   A wide variety of innovative studios and film distributors have
   been using DivX video-on-demand technology to sell downloadable
   DivX titles online since August of last year. One of the many
   interesting films currently available is the Japanese crime
   thriller ""Nobody"" from DivX partner Vanguard Cinema. Called ""a
   triumph"" by the New York Times, ""Nobody"" is an action-packed
   thriller-noir that tells a story of an escalating cycle of
   violence and revenge. In the tradition of international crime
   thrillers like ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Tokyo Fist,"" ""Nobody"" takes
   the viewer through a labyrinth of suspense and carnage without
   release until the very end.

 _Slashdot_: Digital Camera Quality Passing Film?[1] We just hired a 
 photographer for our wedding yesterday, Light Touch Imagery[2]. They offer 
 competitive prices; they can design the type of albums we want (with some 
 amount of artistic touchup); they do bridal and engagement portraits as well as 
 full wedding day coverage; they shoot all digital; and they give us all the 
 digital negatives on CD&#8212;that is, the raw pictures that come straight out 
 of their cameras. No other photographer we met with came close.

 Well, here's my semi-coherent rant for the moment.  ;)
 
 I have >3100 spamtraps on my machine (you can multiply that by each domain
 if you really want to).  The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never
 ever existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to
 deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering
 to 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I
 got around to making them spamtraps.
 
 So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)
 If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,
 it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can
 say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if
 the majority of them don't work.
 
 If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but
 then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through
 someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every
 email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address
 because again it's easy to trace you.
 
 So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think
 you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of
 opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't
 relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.
 
 Everyone else doesn't really care.
 
 
 That's my view anyway. :)

 There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of
 fair use in the US.  For example, audio recordings have such an
 exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't
 (legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can
 control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain
 industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --
 there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such
 privileges on.

 The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
 business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever
 accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make
 money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no
 ""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is
 more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
 profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
 business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
 people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically
 ""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar
 activities, but that is mostly just for show.
 
 Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to
 its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious
 price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.

 We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
 investors like you deserved better. 
 
 Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased

 financial disclosure"" in big business today.
 
 Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
 folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
 stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
 from others when you could count on your own 
 abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 
 
 More than two million people visit our Fool.com web

 the good, the bad and the ugly on every recommendation 
 we make -- so you can make each investing decision 
 with great confidence.
 
 Of course, there's more to our Motley Fool Stock 
 Advisor than our monthly newsletter.
 
 You'll also receive our monthly, between-issue, e-mail 
 Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking

 I think the summary thingy, with a mail based retreive facility, is a
 good alternative. You avoid false positive, only one email to list all
 the spam you received in one day, and you have full per user pref.

 Ther are options that will go up to crazy capacities by using
 using multiple tapes in a caddy... of course its gonna cost
 a lot more.
 
 I'd also be ensuring I had some sort of disk mirroring set up
 also... the more redundancy the better (within reason).

 Subject: [ILUG] Backup solutions
 
 
 Hi folks,
 I maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals,
 and am looking at backup solutions. Is it possible to get some sort of low-
 end internal tape / other solution that could be used to back up approx. 40
 Gigs of data or am I just dreaming? My ISP does offer backups at extra cost
 but the only problem with that is, well, the extra cost.
 
 What I was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device,
 then swap tapes round every month, so I had an onsite backup of say the
 last 24 hours and an offsite backup of the last month. Is this feasible?
 I'm beginning to think it isn't. External devices are not an option as part
 of the charge for colocation is rackspace.
 
 Thanks,
 Ciaran.

 I did that.  It's still really slow when you have thousands of messages.

 I hadn't tried that.  I figured it was better to find out if ""all but
 one"" testing had any appreciable value.  It looks like it doesn't so
 I'll forget about it.

 Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning
 of the message.  In pratice that would probably work fine.

 Never.  I remember the time when I was ten years old and went down to
 the fishing hole with my buddies.  This guy named Gordon had a really
 huge head.  Wait, maybe that was Joe.  Well, no matter.  As I recall, it
 was a hot day and everyone was tired...Human Growth Hormone...girl with
 huge breasts...blah blah blah......

 Morten Frederiksen has taken a first stab at a real-time social network 
 explorer based on FOAF files. You could start on my profile[1] and explore from 
 there, or enter the URL of your own FOAF file (at the bottom of the page). It's 
 heavy on tech details, but you can easily see the potential here. (It's also a 
 great way to debug your FOAF file, if you added anything manually.) Now we need 
 somebody to build a spider that follows foaf:knows links and draws pretty 
 social network diagrams, so we can see the forest for the trees.

 Well, I'm hardly a Gaeilgir, but in general I wouldn't consider
 either ability or inability in a language something to be proud
 of... maybe it's just me, but I'm not proud that I can't speak
 Italian, no more than I'm proud that I can speak French or
 English.

 Probably not.   Next time try clicking on the folder name in the
 sequences window for the sequence.   That is, request that sequence
 be the one displayed in the FTOC.   If the sequence doesn't exist,
 it will be cleaned up then.
 
 Perhaps it would be nicer if flist would do it as well, but this
 is effective enough.

 That's another argument for a ""HLL"" (Habeas Licensee List) which would be less
 inclusive than a test for the mark of for HIL, but more timely and accurate. When an
 ip address is on the HLL it could get a huge negative score, bigger than the Habeas
 mark alone.

 I would question anything being ready for ""production"" being in
 STABLE.
 
 He's kept backwards compatibility with ipfw, which is major plus.
 
 My point about IPFW2 being rolled out into stable was merely an
 illustration of the fact that ipfw is indeed not ipfilter, and that
 there are no license issues there :)

 Please! It does seem that with 7.3 something rather extraordinary has 
 happened! And while there are rpms for plib (as in plib.sf.net), TuxRacer, 
 FlightGear and so on (for SuSE, Mandy and Connectiva, IIRC) dotted around, 
 there are none for 7.3. 
 
 Cheers

","URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000644
 Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00
 
 DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
 it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
 Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
 in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
 licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
 ways encouraged. 
 
 *Tools:*
 1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
 1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
 1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" 
 
 *Process:*
 1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
 you.
 2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
 your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
 3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
 dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. 
 
 Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
 could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
 share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
 violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
 users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. 
 
 *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
 finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
 sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
 please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
 Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.

 Heh. I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first
 started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
 then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.
 
 course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. 
 
 Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
 thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
 spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

 Microsoft will begin selling its directory technology as a standalone product separate from the Windows operating system.
 Microsoft will continue to build in its ""Active Directory"" as part of Windows, but will give its customers the new option of buying the technology as a separate product next year, Microsoft executives said this week. The directory technology essentially provides a network manager with a central database to store and manage information about users, computer systems and networking devices. Microsoft competes against Novell and Sun Microsystems in the directory-server software market.

 Pittman, who also serves as the interim chief exective of the company's America Online unit, could remain at the online division until a permanent CEO is found. But the timetable for Pittman's departure will be based on his own decision, the source added.

7856,"Subject: (PGP problem) EXMH hangs during 'Query keyserver'
","I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
 updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?
 
 My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
 get a button that reads:
 	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
 If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
 then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
 	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
 along with a button with the inscription
 	""Query keyserver""
 If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.
 
 If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
 and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
 must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.
 
 Anyone else with this problem?
 This is EXMH v2.5 and tcl/tk 8.4a4

 There's been some discussion just now on the ILUG IRC channel about OSI and
 protocol layers. This reminded me of a poster produced by Wandel &
 Goltermann (manufactureres of fine protocol decoders and testers) which
 illustrates this admirably. The poster is in the form of a PDF file and to
 be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or
 somesuch device. Wandel & Goltermann has now become/been taken over by
 acterna and I couldn't find the poster there. However, it's available at
 http://www.pb.bib.de/~dozloh/fachinfo/sdn_16/decodes.pdf and some of you ma
 find it interesting.
 
 The top of the poster refers you to www.decodes.com for a more up to date
 online copy of the poster. However, www.decodes.com now is redirected to the
 aforementioned acterna and . . . .

 Why not... it's just that sometimes it gets a bit more confusing in the
 spec file since you have to change the ""Source:"" as well as ""%setup"" to
 reflect the name changes. But it might also sometimes be even easier the
 way you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the
 final version and that only the archive name has a ""pr1"" or ""beta6"" in it
 for example.
 
 Take for instance xmame : I've been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as
 ""0.61-fr0.x"" since the entire source has only ""0.61"" tags everywhere, no
 preversion tags whatsoever.
 
 Still, I don't think ""Epoch:"" is an evil hack although it's true that it
 may cause problems between distributions when used. Wanting to avoid it
 when possible is a good thing indeed ;-)

 Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being
 that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful
 nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to

 You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
 edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
 /home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
 back into place and you're ready to go.
 That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
 /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
 /etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
 again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
 because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
 /boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
 parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
 computers to work for example).

 It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
 only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
 What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
 still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
 executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
 government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
 officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
 and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
 Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
 from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
 can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
 the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
 it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
 this may hold true for other European countries as well.  
 
 After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
 thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.

 ""I knew then that we would have a lot of work on our hands,"" Black said,
 referring to the caseload at La Casa de las Madres, the city's largest
 organization serving women and children affected by domestic violence.
 
 She was right.
 
 Calls to La Casa's crisis line increased by 33% in the last financial
 year, and the service saw a 10 percent increase in the demand for
 beds, with 232 women and 215 children utilizing the shelter service.
 ...
 
 Black said the dot-com collapse and a growing awareness of La Casa's
 services were the two main reasons for the increase in calls.
 
 She said many of her clients had partners who were employed in
 service-industry jobs utilized by dot-com workers

7890,"Subject: The MIME information you requested (last changed 3154 Feb 14)
","--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 What is MIME?
 
 MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
 standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
 world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
 images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
 files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
 of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
 recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 
 
 How can I read a MIME message?
 
 Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
 which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
 number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
 MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
 University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
 ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)
 
 In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
 capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
 not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
 still hope! 
 
 There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
 message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
 at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
 host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
 available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
 older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
 decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 
 
 Does MIME replace UUENCODE?
 
 Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
 that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
 limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
 encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
 message transformations made by certain email gateways. 
 
 How can I learn more about MIME?
 
 The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
 anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including:

         Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)

         Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)

","I don't see why not John, but I'd sure backup my data first ;--)
 
 So I suppose you could setup half of the raid1, copy your partitions across,
 vi lilo to append the new device labels, /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda...
 re-run lilo, then raidhotadd /dev/xxx /dev/md0 [or is that the other way
 around?]
 
 I have never tried this so this could be bollix, I have setup root-raid
 systems but during install time, I have had drive failures on my
 ""production"" systems at home and successfully re-built the raid many times.
 IMHO linux software raid is extremely good.
 
 When are we going to have a pint? 
 
 CW
 
 --------------------------
  I've a running system, and I want to set it up so that the disks are
 mirrored. I'll win a little more read speed, and a lot more reliability.
 
  However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine
 that's new. They don't mention anything about an existing setup. Is it
 possible to setup disk mirroring on a running box ?

1447,"Subject: Daniel Berlinger has noticed that Mac software shops are starting
","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html
 Date: Not supplied
 
 Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
 OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
 who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
 fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
 who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
 over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. 
 
 Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
 business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
 is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
 Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
 of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) 
 
 Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
 with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
 a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
 appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
 to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
 amount of money. 
 
 Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
 That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. 
 
 But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
 to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
 on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
 dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
 in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
 environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
 in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
 magic 25 multiplier.

 Uh... the reason is simple. Habeas runs something called the 
 ""Habeas Infringers List"", and if you use their trademark without 
 their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam 
 with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports 
 this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. 
 This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be 
 prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your 
 servers as fast as you send spam.
 
 Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 
 Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 
 it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has 
 some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to 
 town on violators.
 
 The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
 need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail 
 from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.

 At the 1993 ITAC ""Roadwork"" Conference, Peter Mansbridge asked the

 of the panelists laughed except Bill Buxton.  Peter asked him if he

 Seems Bill didn't know much about how Government really works.  Either
 that, or there's a smelly similarity between Buxton's global Big

 Alas, that's wrong. Both the drives are faster (10..15 krpm vs. ~7 krpm,
 faster seek), and the EIDE protocol is ridiculously dumb (queing;

 None of them are production quality. Right now only ext2 and ext3 qualify.

 Have you looked inside a dual-CPU 1U Dell? Three drives are easy to get 
 in. Anything else would require a redesign, and would in nontrivial 
 thermal engineering issues.

 I can't think of a single major vendor who sells 1U systems with hardware
 EIDE RAID.

 I believe you that stuff can be found, if one is looking for it. However, 
 I wouldn't put this into production unless I've had that system hanging in 
 the local rack under simulated load for a half a year.

 :-).
 
 Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
 this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
 for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
 of slaves, who were brought here by force.
 
 More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.
 
 Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
 wealth has nothing to do with it.
 
 It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
 individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
 statistical sophistry.
 
 
 Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
 is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
 there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
 400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
 since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
 wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
 they're nowhere near the top.
 
 I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
 in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
 monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
 and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
 what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.
 
 In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
 distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
 economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
 people living longer.
 
 I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
 returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

 huh?  i missed all this.  do you want the string all on one line?
 
 the string repeated over and over, but with linebreaks in between,
 this works:
 
     yes ""$STRING"" | head -""$NUMBER""
 
 use sed to remove the newline i guess if you want.  the utilities yes,
 head and sed are on pretty much every unix.

 1. Feedback, notes and comments
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 MACHINIMA  My reputation for small errors continues to grow (I am
 keeping quiet about the big ones) with a misprint in last week's
 piece on this word. In the sentence giving the etymology, of all
 places, I misspelled it ""mechanima"", thus confusing everybody.
 
 APPETITE OVER TIN CUP  Several replies came in about this saying,
 confirming that variations on it and other ways of saying ""head
 over heels"" are widely known, especially ""ass over appetite"" from
 the US, where ""appetite"" may be a transferred term for the mouth.
 But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about,
 ""appetite over tin cup"", seems not to be known much at all. It
 would seem to be a conflation of the British expression ""arse over
 teakettle"" and the American ""ass over appetite"" (note my deliberate
 use of the two spellings of ""arse"" here!). The saying was probably
 modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an
 item less common in America than in Britain. Even in Britain these
 days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression,
 which itself is now not very common.
 
 BUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have pointed out that the word is
 in the lyric of a song sung by Dick Van Dyke in the film ""Chitty
 Chitty Bang Bang"":
 
   Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
   You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
   You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
   But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
 
 It may be one reason why some Americans, not familiar with the word
 in their own country, have come to believe it must be British.
 
 OLOGIES AND ISMS  The publication date of my book has been moved
 back a week in the UK to 29 August. A review by Jonathon Green is
 scheduled for the issue of 31 August (assuming nobody changes the
 date again). See <http://www.worldwidewords.org/ologies.htm> for
 more details and UK ordering information.
 
 
 2. Turns of Phrase: Asian Brown Cloud
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 As though we didn't have enough to worry about weather-wise, what
 with global warming, the ozone hole, and the new El Nio season,
 UN scientists have now identified this new threat to the world's
 climate. It is a cloud of smog three kilometres deep, enveloping
 the whole of southern Asia - a soup of industrial pollutants,
 carbon monoxide from vehicle exhausts and particles of soot from
 burning forests and millions of rural cooking fires. It blocks 15%
 of sunlight, which reduces crop yields. It also creates acid rain,
 leads to respiratory illnesses, reduces rainfall and causes extreme
 weather events. Because the cloud is capable of being dispersed
 rapidly around the world, it may affect a much wider area than just
 Asia. The term ""Asian Brown Cloud"" seems to have been around for a
 couple of years in scientific circles, but came to prominence this
 week in a report prepared by a team of international climatologists
 at the UN Environment Programme in preparation for the World Summit
 on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next week. The good
 news, they say, is that unlike other causes of pollution and
 climate change, this one is curable if Asians can shift to more
 efficient ways of burning fuels.
 
 The ""Asian Brown Cloud,"" a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
 South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
 people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and
 drought in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.
                                    [""Los Angeles Times"", Aug. 2002]
 
 A UN-backed study released on Friday said the ""Asian Brown Cloud"" -
 a vast haze of pollution stretching across South Asia - is damaging
 agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the
 population.

 3. Weird Words: Pyknic  /'pIknIk/
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Short and fat.
 
 Nothing to do with al-fresco meals, though it is said the same way
 as ""picnic"".
 
 In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist
 Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical
 shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses.
 Tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and
 considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft.
 A second set were athletic types with well-developed muscles, whom
 he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. The
 third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of
 the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were
 concerned. He took ""pyknic"" from Greek ""puknos"", thick or close-
 packed; it appeared first in his book ""Krperbau und Charakter""
 (Physique and Character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into
 English.
 
 The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified
 Kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body
 types - ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph"" - that are now
 more common. He considered Kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture
 of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the
 Santa Claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and
 athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type) and came
 up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who
 is muscular in early life but who later goes pear-shaped and
 balloons out into obesity.
 
 
 4. Q&A
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q. A friend and I were reading a recent article in the ""New York
 Times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". I had never heard this
 term before, but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note.
 Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? And can
 you give some insight as to the origin of the term? [Jane
 Rosenthal, California]
 
 A. You're right about the meaning of the phrase.
 
 We have to go back some way to find the origin. The first form was
 the word ""mash"" by itself. This was a slang term in the US in the
 1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as
 ""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). A ""mash"" could also
 be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or - as
 a verb - to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex,
 to flirt or seduce. A ""masher"" was a man who thought himself
 irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often
 unwelcome.
 
 The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the ""Random House
 Historical Dictionary of American Slang"" and by others suggests
 that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre.
 Charles Godfrey Leland (best known for his ""Hans Breitmanns
 Ballads"" about a German immigrant) wrote a note above his poem,
 ""The Masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this:
 
   The word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or
   attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into
   ordinary slang from the American stage. Thus an actress
   was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the
   audience.
 
 ""Mash"" and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about
 1880. ""Masher"" in particular became a term in London society,
 especially among the more raffish supper-club and theatre-going
 classes, for a type of fashionable male. The Oxford English
 Dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing
 away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and
 exaggerated style of dress who frequented music-halls and
 fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'lady-killer'"", noting
 that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"".
 In a letter from London in the old ""Overland Monthly and Out West
 Magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an
 impoverished theatrical company: ""This dashing youth was distinctly
 conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside
 us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that
 superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a
 far higher class"".
 
 A ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an
 obvious enough extension: a love letter. It is recorded first in
 1880 and - as you have discovered - is still doing well.
 
 Where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of
 debate. It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English
 word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious
 reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and
 yielding. Max Beerbohm, writing in London in 1894 (mashers were
 still around then, despite the OED's comment) remarked that some
 people derived it from ""Ma Chre"", ""the mode of address used by the
 gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". But he thought it
 really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a
 great vogue in the music-halls: 'I'm the slashing, dashing, mashing
 Montmorency of the day.'"" We're pretty sure now that he was wrong,
 but he could hardly know that.
 
 Back to Charles Leland again. Apart from his humorous writings, he
 also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as
 well as Gypsy songs and customs. The following note from the
 introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely
 accepted:
 
   It was introduced by the well-known gypsy family of actors,
   C., among whom Romany was habitually spoken. The word
   ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude,
   or entice. It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by
   its quasi-identity with the English word. But there can be
   no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the
   stage. I am indebted for this information to the late well-
   known impresario Palmer of New York, and I made a note of
   it years before the term had become at all popular.
 
 Though defunct in British English, ""mash"" and ""masher"" have never
 quite gone away in America. ""Mash"" had a resurgence of popularity
 as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting,
 though that may be a back-formation from ""mash note"".

","-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

 Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)
 
 Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working
 and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each
 other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to
 have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's
 fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.
 
 In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives
 than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I
 use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I
 tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like
 this exists, yet):
 
         red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from
                 several sources, and noone says ""I know this is NOT
                 spam.""  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or
                 archive it for humor value.  I expect no
                 false-positives to be here.
 
         yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).
 
         green   This is probably not spam.
 
 spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't
 switch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my
 spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports ""doesn't match known spam""
 once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get
 it.

 We in the game industry know what we mean when we say that a game is 
 ""addictive."" We think that quality in a game is a good thing: people like it, 
 they keep coming back to it, and they want to play it more and more. I agree 
 that it's a good thing. If a game has that quality, then it's probably a darn 
 good game. But using the word ""addiction"" to describe that quality does us no 
 favors with the general public.

 _Slashdot_: Digital Camera Quality Passing Film?[1] We just hired a 
 photographer for our wedding yesterday, Light Touch Imagery[2]. They offer 
 competitive prices; they can design the type of albums we want (with some 
 amount of artistic touchup); they do bridal and engagement portraits as well as 
 full wedding day coverage; they shoot all digital; and they give us all the 
 digital negatives on CD&#8212;that is, the raw pictures that come straight out 
 of their cameras. No other photographer we met with came close.

 The following patch removes Ftoc_RescanLine in favour of a 
 Ftoc_RescanLines. It runs scan(1) on a list of lines and updates ftoc 
 accordingly. The patch also changes all the callers to make use of it.
 
 It also changes Ftoc_ClearCurrent to work of an argument instead of 
 falsily clearing a message that's still Current on disk. All in an 
 effort to get a one-to-one disk-display correspondence.
 
 It does add ~30 -- ~ 75 ms (~<10%) to the execution time depending on 
 folder size due to the invocation of scan. However this version does 
 not try to second guess the mh version of scan so if you have exotic 
 scanlines it tells the truth. As a side effect the '+' sign now 
 corresponds better to what's on disk.
 
 Comments appreciated. I'm going to be offlike for a couple of days, 
 so I send the cvs diff rather than putting it in the cvs.

 If you're developing Windows applications in an
 ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
 such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
 advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
 controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
 every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
 handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
 and edit hex code to get you up and running.<p>
 
 
 
 Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
 <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=1a-y6ZkIlXH6wJ46AOd5q0_HZB17WsR"" >FileSystem 1.2</a> and <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=2f-hYaFIqnzAaETrfOP26D_8gaZjMZR"" >AppSecureX 2.9</a>. FileSystem gives you access
 to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
 serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
 applications.<p>

 Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
    FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
    file information under Windows through three independent
    interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
    I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
    Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
    media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
    unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
    files, and even load logbook files into collections
    automatically. Rope in your files.<P>
 
  <B><a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=83-U-BXQYJ7lFkYQzCtuoAABMMPZ9FR"" >ApSecureX 2.9</A></B><BR>
 Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
    This control provides a registration system that produces a
    valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
    the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
    generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
    user must provide you with his installation number. The
    data file created by the application is encrypted
    differently for each system, so even if someone were to
    crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
    another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
    shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
    to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
    works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
    Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
    application is included. Lock up your software.<P>

 AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
    Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
    addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
    uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
    using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
    possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
    customization, and the user interface includes support for
    12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
    applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
    feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
    file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
    support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
    HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
    Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and

 OK, here's a refinement.  Assuming very little spam comes through, we
 only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
 ham to match the new training spam.  The program could randomly select
 a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
 validate this selection.  You could do this once a day or week (config
 parameter).

 I'm trying to think about the end-user issues because I have nothing
 to contribute to the algorithm at this point.  For deployment we need
 both!

","THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME 
 THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! 
 AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV 
 As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. 
 I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just 
 simply delete it. 
 READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy 
 weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. 
 Believe it, work it. 
 This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 
 4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders 
 (money) 
 started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a 
 try!! 
 You will be glad you did. 
 Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't 
 delete this!!! 
 ------------------------------------------------------ 
 First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... 
 AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. 
 PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN 
 IN HIS CLOSET! 
 Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. 
 You most likely have just seen this story recently 
 featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
 And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck 
 of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning 
 and putting laundry away when she came across a large 
 brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath 
 some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 
 15-year-old sons closet. 
 Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got 
 when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. 
 Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - 
 all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
 ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", 
 says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 
 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband 
 earns in a year"". 
 The woman immediately called her husband at the 
 car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she 
 had discovered. He came home right away and they 
 drove together to the boys school and picked him up. 
 Little did they suspect that where the money came from 
 was more shocking than actually finding it in 
 the closet. 
 As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via 
 E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he 
 obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for 
 the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his 
 computer in his bedroom. 
 ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the 
 heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said 
 and I started sending it out"", says the clever 
 15-year-old. 
 The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained 
 instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person 
 on the list, then delete the address at the top and 
 move the others addresses down, and finally to add 
 your name to the top of the list. 
 The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
 several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 
 weeks if you sent out the letter with your 
 name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk 
 E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was 
 going to work"", the boy continues. 
 Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, 
 the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him 
 for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to 
 fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing 
 $5 bills. 
 ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post 
 office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 
 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip 
 that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. 
 I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He 
 goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a 
 whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back 
 home and empty out my backpack because I could not 
 carry it all"". 
 Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending 
 out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I 
 just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, 
 barely had time for my homework"". He had also 
 been riding his bike to several of the banks in his 
 area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
 and hundreds. 
 ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept 
 riding to different banks with like five thousand at a 
 time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at 
 the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to 
 exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. 
 One time the lady gave me a really strange look and 
 told me that she would not be able to do it for me and 
 my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just 
 rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" 
 Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be 
 afraid. The reporting news team examined and 
 investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was 
 sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter 
 at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to 
 US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 
 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also 
 in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, 
 Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service 
 must be exchanged for money received. 
 Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a 
 little note that read, ""Please send me report number 
 XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he 
 was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a 
 five-dollar fee. 
 [This is the end of the media release. If you would 
 like to understand how the system works and get your 
 $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below 
 is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - 
 YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple 
 instructions]. 
 THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 
 ================================================== 
 You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your 
 home!! 
 Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the 
 letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the 
 popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news 
 program 
 recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program 
 described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show 
 also 
 investigated whether or not the program was legal. 
 Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO 
 Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
 the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
 $25 out of pocket cost''. 
 DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS 
 PROGRAM HAS 
 ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 
 This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. 
 I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so 
 glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for 
 the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received 
 total 
 $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. 
 Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 
 =========================================================
 =======Here is 
 another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a 
 long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this 
 again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the 
 simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to 
 come 
 in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that 
 made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering 
 the 
 program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
 key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
 anything.'' More testimonials later but first:

 FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL 
 DREAMS WILL COME 
 TRUE, GUARANTEED! 
 INSTRUCTIONS: 
 ================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
 ================= 
 For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT 
 YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose 
 name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN 
 ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail 
 problems. 
 === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 
 reports. 
 You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
 and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. 
 Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports 
 from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will 
 be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
 from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk 
 in case something happens to your computer. 
 IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed 
 next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other 
 than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will 
 loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
 works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, 
 this 
 method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People 
 have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they 
 could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all 
 have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change 
 anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not 
 work for you. 
 Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 
 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
 and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. 
 This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
 their fortune. 
 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. 
 PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

 **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it 
 on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
 Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist 
 you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you 
 purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which 
 includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of 
 free 
 classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this 
 venture going: 
 METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
 =========================================================
 ======= 
 Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and 
 we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. 
 Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the 
 response 
 could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many 
 people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 
 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. 
 With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 
 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total 
 of 50,000. 
 Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 
 people responded and ordered Report # 2. 
 Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 
 Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 
 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders 
 for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a 
 total of 
 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 
 orders for 
 Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
 million). 
 Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand 
 Total=$555,550.00 
 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE 
 WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
 CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL 
 MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! 
 =========================================================
 ======= 
 REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING 
 OUT 
 OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if 
 everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails 
 each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide 
 and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! 
 METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
 =========================================================
 ======= 
 Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are 
 hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the 
 Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you 
 start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you 
 receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's 
 it. Always provide 
 same day service on all orders. 
 This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your 
 name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise 
 until they receive the report. 
 ===================AVAILABLE REPORTS 
 ========================== 
 ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always 
 send 
 $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure 
 the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On 
 one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you 
 are ordering, 
 YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES 
 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ 
 Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 
 === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
 === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
 should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue 
 advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
 === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN 
 RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will 
 continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your 
 name 
 is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. 
 You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
 people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME 
 SEND 
 ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS 
 AGAIN. There is NO 
 LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!!

 TESTIMONIALS====================== 
 '' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
 accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
 money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 
 ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of 
 the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody 
 totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in 
 with 
 both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 
 ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was 
 on me! 
 Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she 
 had 
 received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have 
 joined 
 Jody in her ''hobby''.

 =========================================================
 ======= '' Not 
 being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
 mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided 
 that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that 
 I 
 wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
 surprised 
 when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made 
 $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is 
 that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better 
 investment 
 with a faster return and so big''. 
 Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
 =========================================================
 ======= '' I had 
 received this program before. I deleted it, but later I 
 wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who 
 to contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed 
 again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came 
 again.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my 
 first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''.

 =========================================================
 ====== 
 '' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
 little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
 within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
 $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ 
 362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

 Planning battle tactics; for this reason, the intelligence press
 reports, spy satellites have had 1-meter resolution for many years.
 
 Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be possible
 with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.
 
 For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably cheaper
 to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take some snapshots
 from ground level.  Aerial photos might be cheaper for large areas,
 areas where you're not allowed --- or, perhaps, physically able --- to
 go, and cases where you don't have time to send a ground guy around
 the whole area.

 Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
 e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
 it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
 Outlook.

 When we get more (good) ""nice"" tests, the GA will assign lower
 scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are
 very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
 of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
 problem to solve.

 Actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have 
 resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page (and musical  instrumnet, 
 and canvas)  What's the problem if we dash a little Mrs. Dash on them?  (:  
 Or cayenne.  Or ginger. (mm ask me about ginger root play).  
 
 And let me tell you this: just because a child happens to be 
 single-parented (what a word), does not mean that child is dysfunctional 
 or lives in a dysfunctional home.  The govt/media/church has tried to make 
 it look like there is a disintegration, when in fact, there is a coming 
 together of other family members and friends to raise children.  It's not 
 decaying -- it's changing.  Nothing wrong with change.

4953,"Subject: [ILUG] ASSISTANCE
","FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. 
 DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
 Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
 Dear Sir/Madam
 
 
 SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 
 
 Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
 is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
 dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
 and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
 and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
 Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
 the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
 Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
 his soul rest in peace. 
 
 Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
 my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
 instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
 ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
 Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
 group. We were then given this money privately 
 by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
 Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
 was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
 were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
 immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
 in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
 said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
 seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
 (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
 Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
 President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
 Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
 
 In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
 can assist us to move this money out of my country 
 as the beneficiary. 
 WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
 Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
 name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
 ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
 will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 
 
 Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
 our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
 (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
 with the late President Kabila, immediately 
 after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
 the information We gathered from an associate 
 who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
 your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
 be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
 weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
 therefore requires a total confidentiality. 
 
 We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
 fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
 restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
 order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
 so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
 of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
 addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
 information to enable us discuss the 
 modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
 
 Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
 Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
 guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
 soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
 us. 
 
 I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
 utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
 confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
 Thank you and God Bless. 
 Best Regards 
 
 
 COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com

","
 Hello Unlimited International Telephone Call Marketer,
 
 If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

 Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.
 
 In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

","
 Don't know much about eRoom - but there is the magic phrase 'collaborate in
 real-time'... Groove really has people running scared. Wonder if any users
 actually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.
 
 
 ===
 http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/INW20021004S0001
 
 Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
 privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.
 
 Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
 and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
 eRoom.
 
 Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
 makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
 Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.
 
 Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
 Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
 tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
 according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.
 
 With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
 real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
 jointly creating content.
 
 Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
 workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
 simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.
 
 For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
 content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
 integration is planned down the line, the companies said.

 Greetings!
 
 If you're thinking about a new job, now's the time to
 aggressively pick up your search. Many people slow
 their job search donw in summer months when in fact
 it's the best time to look!
 
 Here's why.  Many companies implement a new direction
 or strategy at the first of the year, resulting in a
 first of the year hiring surge. By mid year, with
 results in hand, companies start hiring again to
 expand on or adjust for the results of their first of
 the year plans.
 
 While employers start hiring, job seekers start
 slowing their search efforts down. This creates an
 optimal job seeking environment of more jobs and less
 competition!
 
 To best take advantage of this situation you should give
 yourself massive exposure by signing up to all the top
 career sites as soon as possible. Of course it will take
 a little time, but it's well worth it. The top career
 sites are visited by 1.5 million employers and recruiters

 After that ""kill -9"", removing the ""__*"" files in /var/lib/rpm/ and trying

 Let's say you're behind a firewall and have a NAT address.
 Is there any way to telnet to a linux box out there in the world
 and set your DISPLAY in some way that you can create
 xterms on your own screen?

 I'm in no way a pro but perhaps you could set your Firewall to accept con=

 As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
 I understand you:  If I don't use the ""nomime"" => 1 option and I recieve 
 MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.
 
 Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
 mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
 ""nomime"" => 1?

 No. My past experiences with DSL have generally been miserable so I went
 with at&t digital cable[1] + cable modem. Still, even the hypothetical
 option was a lot better than what I had in the theoretically
 tech-friendly Triangle in NC.

 Limbo beta2 ? I'm running Limbo 7.3.92 with kernel 4.2.18-5.58, is what I am running
 an ""older"" version of the Limbo beta, it is it ""the"" limbo beta?
 
 btw, it does have that gconf editor included.
 
 I dumped the RPMS from the Limbo cd's 1 to 3 onto a drive, ran a few scripts, edited
 sources.list (rpm file:///path-to-files/RPMS.os os [I think]) and used ""apt-get
 dist-upgrade"", worked like a charm. The real RH installer couldnot handle an upgrade
 for me, it froze ""searching for packages"".

 That's ""angle"" as in geometry.

 Great email[1] from the RIAA's Hillary Rosen to execs at Yahoo, Real, AOL and 
 Microsoft, on how to crack down on the millions of Morpheus and Kazaa users. Is

 I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
 makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
 official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
 provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
  However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.
 
 Good luck...

4621,"Subject: Re: Encryption approach to secure web applications
","Hi,
 
 Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
 tutorials in the ibm developer connection.
 
 https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1
 
 and
 
 https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2
 
 Registration is needed.
 
 I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
 suggested by someone.
 
 For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
 approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).
 
 I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
 implementation at anytime.
 
 Thank you again!
 
 Mario Torre

 Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all 
 you 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html"">Dreamweaver users</a> out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
 with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
 of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
 easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
 until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
 I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
 so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to 
 <a href=""http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html"">check 'em out too</a>.
 <p>
 As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
 switched cell phones to the 
 <a href=""http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htm"">Kyocera QCP6035</a>. 
 The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
 functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
 you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
 cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
 already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
 driving directions. 
 <p>
 Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
 more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
 I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
 be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
 in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.

 As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
 this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
 mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
 e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
 the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
 confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
 to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
 following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
 interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
 with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
 Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
 mySQL are useful in getting this installed.

 Think of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
 OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
 adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
 telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
 effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
 making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
 even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
 jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
 to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
 adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
 by not having this software.

 ""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
 background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
 may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""
 
 Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
 haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
 simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.

 Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
 happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
 their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
 you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
 sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
 real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
 limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
 an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
 specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
 presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
 be able to make every site you design more user friendly.

 I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
 a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
 itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
 desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
 documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
 their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
 management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
 look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
 detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
 modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
 discussion forum for trading ideas.

 I can't stand it either when it's at work or home and I'd planned on doing
 something that required network access... but I really feel like I need a
 break now, away from work pressure that almost drove me nuts all summer!
 Ah, the joys of responsibilities... :-/
 
 Six days without computers ahead, but six days driving my 600 Bandit
 roadster bike! I won't be miserable nor get bored, don't worry for me ;-)
 I also have the first Lord of the Rings book to finish (half way through
 now) and the two others to read... lots of ""sane"" and non-wired occupations
 ahead!
 Oh, did I mention beer drinking with friends? :-))))

 If u choose Setup NT from the installation CD it will reboot your system
 and give the option of repairing an existing installation when it reboots.
 I did this the other night, with the check MBR option, but it didn't

","
 Forwarded-by: Flower
 
 Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
 sexually active or not?
 
 1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
    make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
    hair shiny and skin smooth.
 
 2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
    dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
    the pores and makes your skin glow.
 
 3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
    romantic dinner.
 
 4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
    and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
    than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!
 
 5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
    endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
    leaving you with a feeling of well-being.
 
 6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
    active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
    pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!
 
 7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
    EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.
 
 8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
    saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
    that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.
 
 9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
    the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.
 
 10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
     antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.
 
 ENJOY SEX!

  Yes. Especially in the languages he was talking about - C, Pascal and
 Assembler. Goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel
 code to improve efficency. They are almost required in some languages
 (like C) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches
 to break out of.
 
  But, in general, goto's make a mess of code.

  Recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. People
 that think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler.

  I don't care, to be honest.

 not legal, more management/corporate fashion. cause most of the
 actual /legal/ opinion on the web i've found on the web indicates:
 
 1. they should be used /sparingly/
 
 blanket pre/appending of disclaimers /dilutes/ any legal
 effectiveness they have.
 
 2. they are not binding, and have little meaning other than in 
 certain situations.
 
 they are not binding. 
 
 though there are some situations where for proffessional reasons one
 may wish to indicate the standing of an email. (eg legal advice ""this
 is / is not legal advice"" type of thing. But again, this means 
 disclaimers need to context-specific. (see 1.)
 
 3. there is precedence that blanket disclaimers, under UK law, have 
 no standing and that rather (common sense this) it is the context of 
 the situation that determines the legal effects of an email.
 
 See the norwich union case. 
 
 Anyway, my top tips to help superiors who've fallen for disclaimers 
 to see sense:
 
 1. server side appends breaks email standards. (unless always done 
 correctly - nearly impossible, cause then server has to understand 
 every possible type of client encoding).
 
 1a. it /does/ break certain types of encryption, that depend on the 
 body being untouched. (eg X.509? kate brought this up ages ago).
 
 1b. iirc, it contravenes MIME to pre/append non mime-typed text. Most 
 mailers will work around this and display the mail 'correctly', some 
 might not though. Eg the message might not be displayed, or the 
 disclaimer might not be displayed.
 
 1c. the correct place for disclaimers is on the client side. this 
 also allows the user to select appropriate disclaimer for appropriate 
 context (or no disclaimer at all).
 
 2. blanket appended disclaimers are of dubious legal effectiveness. 
 (dilution, NU case in UK)
 
 3. generic disclaimer text is of dubious legal effectiveness. indeed
 it will often be completely inappropriate ('this message is
 confidential' on list mail). see 1c. Also, it needs to be written by 
 an actual lawyer.
 
 4. A lot of big multinational corporations do /not/ append 
 disclaimers. (ones i know of: Compaq (deceased), Motorol (iirc), 
 Microsoft (iirc)).
 
 Useful link:
 
 http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/
 (and see links at bottom of this page).
 
 finally, if you cant get reason to prevail and you have to agree to
 implementing server side disclaimers, you can still resort to:
 
 	""that'll be done just as soon as the company stationary has
 	disclaimers printed on them. oh, and i guess we'll have to play a
 	disclaimer before or after all our telephone calls too? 
 	Wait, that would cause a problem for faxes wouldnt it?""

 THE BUZZ ABOUT THE UPCOMING MOVIE
 
 People are already talking about the sensitive subject of kids and drug addiction featured in ""The Secret Life of Zoey.""
 Lifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:
 ""My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn't dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe
  rson I can be.""

 I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the
 infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters
 and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
 from making money on advertisements that are deemed
 thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary
 government board.  As it was posted to ""discussion"" I
 thought there'd be some.
 
 Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill
 lamenting the fact that some people know how to
 fill out a permit so that they can take advantage
 of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously
 he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups
 get specific ""zones"" and that it's not up to the
 police to decide what messages and signs get put into
 what zones to most expediently keep order.  
 
 The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
 nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
 political rallies that you don't agree with has become
 common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled
 that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.
 They teach you that your very first year of law school.
 
 I think that given the information as laid out by the story,
 Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free
 speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
 every American seems to involve the ability to communicate
 an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing
 a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience
 that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical 
 effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. 
 
 I think Bill Neel of Butler needs to go back to school
 as obviously he must have been sleeping in his civics
 class or else they didn't teach civics in mini-guantanamo, OH
 65 years ago.

 I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.
 
 Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
 and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
 pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
 the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
 also have a message board.
 
 The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
 userfriendly.
 
 All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
 Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
 shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

 I wouldn't make that assumption.  I'd assume that rewrite_subject was on, 
 and report_header was off, because that's the default configuration, and 
 not everyone knows to go look in the user_prefs file to make those 
 changes.

","the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the
 universe. too big to decrypt.
 
 my point is there will never be a ""safe"" key. what I would consider is how
 long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for
 longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to
 stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what
 is available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not
 release the data to the public.
 
 I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking
 the key gives away it's secret.
 
 the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP
 for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the
 nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we
 needed to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the
 XP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.
 
 the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my
 computer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me
 return them and get my money back.
 
 the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.

6686,"Subject: Psyche: Anyone else tried it?
","
     Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind.  :)
 
     I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.
 
     This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.

 Because you then have a system that is ineffective to a varying degree. A
 simplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam
 that could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that
 many, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you
 factor in report times.

 Wrong. razor-check will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches
 something already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have
 never seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for
 filtering?

 No, it means that the people doing the revoking have a different opinion
 than the 1000 people who have submitted it as spam. Rather the 1000 people
 who have reported the message as spam constitute a majority or not is
 something that would have to be determined in the context of the
 individual message.

 It's my opinion that it's not my job to unsubscribe to any list that I
 haven't subscribed to, nor is it necessarily in my best interest given
 that some parties sending unwanted communications may utilize the
 unsubscribe request as a method of determining they are mailing a valid
 address.

 There are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
 would, at first hearing, expect them to. Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, 
 was one. Google News[1] is another. 
 
 In its first day, I've already noticed: 
 
 - The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's 
 terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by 
 the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the 
 late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. 
 - The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? 
 The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news 
 site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very 
 obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? 
 - Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them 
 copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have 
 to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

","Hi all...
 
 I'm new to SpamAssasin so I appologies if the question has been asked
 before.
 I'm thinking of setting up SA with my Qmail(Maildir) server acting as our
 gateway.
 It currently provides inline virus scanning and ORDB open relay filtering.
 Is it possible to setup SA to act as a sitewide Spam filter ?
 Is there any documentation on setting this up ?
 The Qmail server does not house any local mail accounts, it acts as a pure
 relay for our internal mail server, I am currently relaing mail for 8
 internal domains...
 
 Suggestions would be appreciated.

 Zenn

 Many spammers make money not from response to the spam, but from selling
 the service of spamming on behalf of someone else.  You might track down
 whoever paid for the mailing, but tracking down the actual sender might be
 more difficult, and even if they manage to recover damages from the buyer
 they haven't stopped the spammer, so the benefit is strictly to Habeas,
 not to the recipients of the spam.  That's the main problem I have with
 the whole scenario: My pain, Habeas's gain, and those most likely to be
 held liable are those least likely to be the really serious abusers.

 This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
 less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
 threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
 nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
 interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
 have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
 better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
 most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
 players.
 
 Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
 find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
 unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

 Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
 obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
 dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
 government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
 the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
 we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
 against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
 in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
 military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
 missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
 never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
 covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.
 
 Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
 meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
 under any other guise.

 Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
 the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
 faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
 European way of doing things is beyond me.
 
 The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
 for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
 anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
 I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
 coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. 
 
 For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
 but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

 I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
 majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
 country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
 anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
 Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
 the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
 Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
 from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
 way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
 years.
 
 I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.
 
 First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
 culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
 North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
 very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
 hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
 foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
 having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
 identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
 Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
 your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
 language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
 wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
 Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
 than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
 farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.
 
 Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
 neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
 In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
 German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
 only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
 superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?
 
 In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
 US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
 relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
 similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
 dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
 advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
 understand a word they are saying either.

 It sounds like the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff rather than hardware.

 I think that the AT command for hardware flow control is &E4 though this
 may vary from modem to modem.

     Interview with Naomi Hancock, PR Manager, Veuve Clicquot UK - July 10=
 ,=20
 2002
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------=20
 =20
   On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20
 Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20
 =20
 Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20
 UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20
 most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =
 -=20
 known locally as The English Season.=20
 
 Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20
 communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=
 =20
 events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=
 =20
 
 
   Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20
 tool?
 
 Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=
 =20
 brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20
 the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20
 believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20
 
 
   Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?
 
 We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20
 the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20
 enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20
 development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20
 make The Season central to our marketing mix.=20
 
 
   Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?
 
 We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20
 mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=
 =20
 frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20
 the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20
 comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.
 
 We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20
 related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=
 l=20
 like to be involved in such a decision.=20
 
 
   What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?
 
 Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20
 decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20
 This is our rule and frame of investment.
 
 
   What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?
 
 Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=
 -
 vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20
 magazine of all kinds).=20
 
 Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20
 complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=
 =20
 similar status, but differing interests.=20
 
 
   Please describe one of your sponsorships
 
 The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=
 y=20
 Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=
 =20
 Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20
 Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20
 group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=
 =20
 king of sports.
 
 
   What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?
 
 Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20
 portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20
 organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20
 Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20
 getting a good return on our investment.
 
 
   How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?

 As usual for me, this is an aggregate of 20 runs, each both training and
 predicting on 4000 c.l.py ham + ~2750 BruceG spam.
 
 Only 25 ham scores out of 80,000 are above 0.025 now (and, yes, the
 ""Nigerian scam""-quoting msg is still counted as ham -- I haven't taken
 anything out of the ham corpus since remving the ""If AOL were a car"" spam),
 the f-p rate wouldn't have changed at all if the spamprob cutoff were
 dropped from 0.90 to 0.675, dropping the cutoff to 0.40 would have added
 only 2 false positives, and dropping it to 0.15 would have added only
 another 2 more!
 
 It's spooky.

 If you need another apt repository with Red Hat Linux 7.2 files, there are

 Agreed.
 
 But I have always thought that the value 5 was not the best value.  It
 should have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores
 were included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely
 symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been
 balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.
 Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative
 would be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's
 choice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assume
 things work differently than they do.

 KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
 mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
 as she rode an escalator here, police said.
 
 Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
 was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law
 forbidding people from creating a public nuisance.
 
 Hamano admits to the allegations.
 
 Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at
 JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
 underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted
 to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter.
 She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs.

 difficult and frustrating.

 To paraphrase something I heard once:
 Unless you like looking for a new job, never install a non-released or
 development-only version of software anywhere where the results of such
 code are important.
 
 ie: Don't run development code on a production machine. :)
 
 
 The problem isn't SA anyway, it looks for Razor1 and just keeps on
 going if it can't find it.  Something came up about amavis on the SA
 list where it looks for Razor itself...

","i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?
 
 anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.

","I wish I could answer your question but my laptop does not have the digital stuff

 I have used these commands to explore ALSA and my chip:
 
 arecord -l   (list devices)
 arecord -L   (list PCM decices)
 
 I get some output like this:

 EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
 Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
 By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
 
 WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
 sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
 Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.
 
 The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
 push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
 and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.
 
 While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
 exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
 animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
 risk to humans.
 
 ""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
 exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health
 effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
 uncertainties are involved.""
 
 The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
 world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
 significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
 emissions under the Clean Air Act.
 
 Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
 administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
 would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
 separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.
 
 EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
 the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
 the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
 the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
 meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.
 
 The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
 although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
 is expected to produce pollution reductions.
 
 The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
 probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
 diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
 gauging pollution health concerns.
 
 But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are
 considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
 cancer risk to an individual.
 
 Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal
 and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be
 carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
 environmental exposure.""
 
 The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
 short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
 ""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and
 other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
 as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.
 
 Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
 to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
 diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
 expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
 sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.
 
 Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
 environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to
 harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
 clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
 standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""
 
 Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
 Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is
 clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
 cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""
 
 The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
 the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
 turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.

","Hi,
 
 I believe you get more value for money by separating the mobile phone from 
 the PDA.
 
 As expressed by power users on Open, a combination like a EUR 160 Nokia 
 6310i talking to a EUR 440 Palm m515 will meet your specification. By using 
 a EUR 90 Bluetooth SD chip, the Palm and the Nokia 6310i can talk to one 
 another even when not in line of sight.

 	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
 (probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 
 
 	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
 get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this

4121,"Subject: Re: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its
","Hi Kragen,
 
    This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple
 of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will
 be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the
 most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix
 their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and
 you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you
 might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.
 
    There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very
 important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes
 of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available
 vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated
 methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about
 the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into
 a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you
 can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so
 you can make and test predictions.
 
    I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
 wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
 admin's job would be a lot harder.

 | Date: Thu, 22 Aug 2002 00:24:54 -0400 (EDT)
 | From: Kragen Sitaker <kragen@pobox.com>
 | To: fork@example.com
 | Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards
 | 
 | On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
 | which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
 | itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
 | for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
 | that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
 | anyone else.
 | 
 | If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
 | very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
 | 
 | At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
 | known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
 | vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
 | while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
 | --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
 | vulnerability, if possible.  
 | 
 | This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
 | CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
 | disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
 | any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
 | a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
 | vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
 | on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
 | wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
 | was.
 | 
 | The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
 | exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
 | disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
 | underground, vulnerable.
 | 
 | The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
 | are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
 | reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
 | turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
 | detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
 | useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
 | security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
 | prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
 | long as possible.
 | 
 | iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
 | than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
 | a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
 | discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
 | 
 | Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
 | including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
 | secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
 | vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
 | Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
 | HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
 | extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
 | information.
 | 
 | If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
 | together, add up to a catastrophe.
 | 
 | First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
 | the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
 | I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
 | syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
 | 
 | Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
 | become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
 | --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
 | guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
 | of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
 | 
 | I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
 | vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
 | plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
 | them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
 | people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
 | credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
 | Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
 | administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
 | negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
 | 
 | I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
 | information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
 | execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
 | means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
 | are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
 | 
 | There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
 | Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
 | than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
 | Samba, for example.
 | 
 | Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
 | motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
 | interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
 | personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
 | a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
 | increase the availability of that information to the people who can
 | afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
 | 
 | Let's not let that happen.

 | 
 | From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com]
 | Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM
 | Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
 | 
 | 
 | Greetings,
 | 
 | iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
 | Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
 | notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
 | 
 | iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
 | provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
 | 
 | Q. How will it work?
 | A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
 | security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
 | of motivations, including the following:
 | 
 |          * Pure love of security research
 |          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
 |          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
 |          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
 | 
 | The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
 | Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
 | work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
 | items:

 | Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
 | A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
 | entity.
 | 
 | Q. Why are you launching this program?
 | A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
 | to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
 | often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
 | original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
 | compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
 | public at large are warned in a timely manner.
 | 
 | Q. Who gets the credit?
 | A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
 | exploit information.
 | 
 | Q. When can I contribute?
 | The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.
 | 
 | To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
 | questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
 | contact us at contributor@idefense.com.

454,"Subject: [Razor-users] SpamNet question
","Vipul, can I ask questions about SpamNet here?
 
 I hope so, here goes.. simple question.  How do you define
 username/passwords in spamnet?  I don't see any fields for this option, so
 I'm assuming when someone connects with SpamNet for the first time, they're
 given a unique ID that they keep until they change to a new Outlook client?
 
 It would be nice if you could specify which username/password to use.  I'd
 like to share my trust account between my work(outlook) and my personal(mutt)
 email accounts.

5775,"Subject: RE: [SAtalk] user_prefs ignored
","This is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct
 me!
 
 Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
 global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
 root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.
 
 >>From the spamc man page:
 
        -u username
            This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
            per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
            files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
            other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
            then you can still use this flag.
 
 
 The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
 spamc. From the procmailrc man page:
 
        DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                    it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                    useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                    half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                    behalf of the recipient.
 
 
 I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

 |
 | Hi All,
 |
 | I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
 | with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
 | /etc/procmailrc.
 |
 | spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with
 | any flags.
 |
 | When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
 | ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
 | I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which
 | gets reported in every e-mail on the ""X-Spam-Status"" line.
 |
 | Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
 | ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
 | e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
 | to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
 | e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
 |
 | Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or
 | procmail bug?
 |
 | Thanks,
 |
 | Cheryl

 Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about 
 life on Earth today.
 
 The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy 
 that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in 
 an imperfect world.

 I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, 
 our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in 
 practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
 Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
 taking share from every other government broadcaster.
 
 It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
 as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.
 
 Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
 centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
 ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
 platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
 they might.
 
 As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make 
 as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
 about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
 might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
 our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
 overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
 how engaged we are in the world around us.
 
 Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
 globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 
 stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 
 the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.
 
 Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the 
 real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. 
 I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit 
 such a principle to be loosed upon the world.

 Full Text: Bush's National Security Strategy
 
 Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
 strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 
 United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
 the Administration's policy.
 
 INTRODUCTION
 
 THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
 totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
 freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
 democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
 nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
 guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
 potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
 everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 
 worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 
 property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
 are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
 protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
 freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.
 
 Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
 strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
 heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
 unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
 favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
 can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
 economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
 world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
 against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
 by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
 peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.
 
 Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
 commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
 dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
 industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
 individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
 than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
 penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
 against us.
 
 To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
 from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
 cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
 reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
 nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
 hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
 allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
 countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
 new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
 turn.
 
 The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
 and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
 weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
 so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
 succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
 means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
 contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
 technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
 will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
 cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
 be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
 and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
 saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
 entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.
 
 As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
 opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
 has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
 seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
 instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
 find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
 violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
 interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
 common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
 for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
 leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
 national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
 freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
 the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
 because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
 international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
 powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
 trade, and cultural advancement.
 
 Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
 the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
 the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
 every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
 that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
 national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
 into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
 corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
 drug cartels within their borders.
 
 The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
 better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
 trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
 out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
 nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
 build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
 The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
 the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
 invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
 continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
 AIDS and other infectious diseases.
 
 In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
 guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
 responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
 Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
 spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
 aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
 freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.
 
 We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
 better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
 the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
 to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
 Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
 other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
 these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
 are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
 rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.
 
 Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 
 every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
 been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 
 clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 
 it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
 holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
 these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
 this great mission.
 
 I. Overview of America's International Strategy
 
 
 ""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
 fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
 liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
 and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
 the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
 open societies on every continent.""
 
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 West Point, New York
 June 1, 2002
 
 
 
 The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
 and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
 liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
 unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
 strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
 favors freedom.
 
 For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
 struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
 equality.
 
 That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
 race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
 discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
 are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
 catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
 defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.
 
 This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
 translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
 and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
 distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
 values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
 make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
 progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
 with other states, and respect for human dignity.
 
 And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.
 
 To achieve these goals, the United States will:
 
 *	champion aspirations for human dignity;
 
 *	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
 attacks against us and our friends;
 
 *	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;
 
 *	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
 friends, with weapons of mass destruction;
 
 *	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
 free trade;
 
 *	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
 the infrastructure of democracy;
 
 *	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
 global power; and
 
 *	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
 challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.
 
 
 II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity
 
 
 ""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
 language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
 different methods, but not different moralities.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 West Point, New York
 June 1, 2002
 
 
 
 In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
 stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
 these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
 owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
 mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
 free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
 oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
 the secret police.
 
 America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
 dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; 
 free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 
 religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.
 
 These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
 us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
 facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
 core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
 been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
 aspirations of their people.
 
 Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
 our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
 Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
 stronger, but is a freer and more just society.
 
 Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
 when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
 and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
 we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
 the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
 America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
 evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
 cherish.
 
 Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
 the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
 these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.
 
 Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
 cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
 of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
 bodies.
 
 We will:
 
 *	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
 human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
 advance freedom;
 
 *	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
 struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
 democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;
 
 *	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
 themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
 from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
 to move toward a better future; and
 
 *	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
 and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.
 
 
 We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
 it.
 
 III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
 Attacks Against Us and Our Friends
 
 
 ""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
 the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
 clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
 waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
 peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
 the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
 our choosing.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
 September 14, 2001
 
 
 
 The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
 global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
 religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
 politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.
 
 In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
 lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
 within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
 States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
 with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
 knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.
 
 The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
 our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
 elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
 through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
 unseen.
 
 Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
 and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
 achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 
 forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
 only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
 trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
 America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.
 
 Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
 organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 
 control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 
 have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.
 
 We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
 coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
 campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
 the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
 tools necessary to finish the task.
 
 The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
 financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
 funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
 support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
 system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
 and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
 financial networks.
 
 However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
 cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
 seek.
 
 We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:
 
 *	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
 international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
 organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
 terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
 (WMD) or their precursors;
 
 *	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
 at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
 reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
 enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
 to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
 acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
 harm against our people and our country; and
 
 *	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
 by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
 responsibilities.
 
 
 We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
 terrorism. This includes:
 
 *	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
 with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
 illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
 slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
 can condone or support and all must oppose;
 
 *	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
 world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
 terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;
 
 *	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
 enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
 on areas most at risk; and
 
 *	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
 information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
 those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.
 
 
 While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
 strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
 attack.
 
 This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
 since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
 and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
 Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
 reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
 encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
 and the private sector.
 
 This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
 emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
 terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
 to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
 mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
 terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.
 
 While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
 in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
 Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
 and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
 governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
 will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
 our allies can provide.
 
 As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
 with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
 non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
 humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
 rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
 threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists
 
 In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
 ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
 and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
 conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
 productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
 ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
 
 IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts
 
 
 ""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
 The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
 look so small.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Berlin, Germany
 May 23, 2002
 
 
 
 Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
 disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
 an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
 alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
 horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
 falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
 alleviate suffering and restore stability.
 
 No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
 direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
 and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
 will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:
 
 *	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
 international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
 crises when they emerge.
 
 *	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
 those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
 people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.
 
 
 Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
 apply these principles:
 
 The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
 human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
 of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
 to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
 for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
 to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
 peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
 government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
 counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
 parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
 comprehensive settlement to the conflict.
 
 The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
 stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
 development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
 establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
 Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
 corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
 for the creation of a Palestinian state.
 
 Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
 Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
 United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
 steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
 As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
 fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
 with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
 activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
 freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
 to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
 role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
 Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.
 
 In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
 and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
 time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
 Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
 constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
 Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
 choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
 open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
 become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
 and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
 involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
 bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
 that can help defuse military confrontation.
 
 Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
 respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
 the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
 employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
 neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
 Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.
 
 In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
 countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
 Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
 hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
 opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
 the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
 (OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
 the entire hemisphere.
 
 Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
 from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
 and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
 security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
 strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
 their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
 drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
 in our own country.
 
 In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
 groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
 activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
 working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
 illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
 sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
 security to the Colombian people.
 
 In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
 and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
 States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
 combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
 therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
 African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
 Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
 fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
 borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 
 infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.
 
 An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 
 spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 
 of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 
 confronting these emerging transnational threats.
 
 Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 
 focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 
 administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 
 region:
 
 *	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 
 Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 
 and require focused attention;
 
 *	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 
 essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 
 operations; and
 
 *	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 
 must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 
 threats on a sustained basis.
 
 
 Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 
 surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 
 conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 
 waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 
 the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 
 common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 
 opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.
 
 V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 
 with Weapons of Mass Destruction
 
 
 ""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 
 technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 
 weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 
 even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 
 strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 
 have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 
 capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 
 we will oppose them with all our power.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 West Point, New York
 June 1, 2002
 
 
 
 The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 
 allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 
 force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 
 collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 
 environment has undergone profound transformation.
 
 Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 
 relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the 
 balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear 
 arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as 
 counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 
 inconceivable.
 
 But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 
 None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 
 that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 
 motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 
 destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 
 states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 
 destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 
 and dangerous.
 
 In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 
 states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 
 attributes. These states:
 
 *	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 
 for the personal gain of the rulers;
 
 *	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 
 and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;
 
 *	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 
 other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 
 to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;
 
 *	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and
 
 *	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 
 for which it stands.
 
 
 At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 
 designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 
 Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 
 weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 
 the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 
 increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 
 Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 
 well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 
 become a looming threat to all nations.
 
 We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 
 before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 
 against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 
 take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 
 partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 
 forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 
 missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 
 collection and analysis.
 
 Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:
 
 *	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 
 against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 
 capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 
 capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 
 homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 
 into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 
 our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 
 adversaries.
 
 *	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 
 terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 
 necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 
 arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 
 assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 
 necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 
 continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 
 increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 
 threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 
 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 
 forward.
 
 *	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 
 use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 
 WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 
 weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 
 enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 
 must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 
 forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.
 
 
 It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 
 this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 
 United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 
 in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 
 of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 
 caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 
 We cannot let our enemies strike first.
 
 *	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 
 faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 
 effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 
 retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 
 more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 
 the wealth of their nations.
 
 *	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 
 weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 
 used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 
 of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 
 military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 
 allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 
 allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 
 of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 
 of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.
 
 *	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 
 terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 
 targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 
 and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 
 states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 
 action.
 
 
 For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 
 an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 
 against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 
 and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 
 on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 
 mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.
 
 We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 
 objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 
 seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 
 fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 
 of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 
 and delivered covertly and without warning.
 
 The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 
 population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 
 of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 
 mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 
 these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 
 and used weapons of mass destruction.
 
 The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 
 to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 
 threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 
 the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 
 uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 
 forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 
 States will, if necessary, act preemptively.
 
 The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 
 threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 
 Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 
 the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 
 remain idle while dangers gather.
 
 We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 
 actions. To support preemptive options, we will:
 
 *	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 
 timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;
 
 *	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 
 most dangerous threats; and
 
 *	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 
 conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.
 
 
 The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 
 to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 
 actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.
 
 VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 
 Free Trade.
 
 
 ""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 
 privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 
 enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 
 better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 
 revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Monterrey, Mexico
 March 22, 2002
 
 
 
 A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 
 prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 
 supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 
 incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 
 economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 
 reinforces the habits of liberty.
 
 We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 
 shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 
 policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 
 economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 
 policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 
 growth, including:
 
 *	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 
 investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;
 
 *	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 
 improve incentives for work and investment;
 
 *	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 
 confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 
 endeavors;
 
 *	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 
 efficient use;
 
 *	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;
 
 *	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 
 skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and
 
 *	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 
 diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 
 opportunity.
 
 
 The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not 
 command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 
 best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 
 strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 
 all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 
 developing world.
 
 A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 
 national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 
 for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 
 of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 
 their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 
 Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 
 non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 
 use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 
 including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 
 are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 
 global economic growth.
 
 Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 
 growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 
 the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 
 markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 
 living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 
 world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 
 allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 
 their future.
 
 We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 
 access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 
 continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 
 markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 
 Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 
 Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 
 more effectively resolving them when they occur.
 
 The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 
 occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 
 so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 
 conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 
 achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 
 exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.
 
 The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it 
 became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 
 value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 
 that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 
 freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 
 trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:
 
 *	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 
 helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 
 especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 
 completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 
 accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 
 Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.
 
 *	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 
 in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 
 the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 
 States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 
 targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 
 government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 
 poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 
 allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 
 trade.
 
 *	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 
 free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 
 will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 
 Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 
 developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 
 Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 
 be our principal focal points.
 
 *	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 
 administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 
 Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 
 majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 
 Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 
 developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 
 work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 
 agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 
 Promotion Authority.
 
 *	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 
 policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 
 competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 
 societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 
 integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 
 developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 
 Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 
 produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 
 use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 
 to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 
 countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 
 the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 
 health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 
 flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 
 medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
 malaria.
 
 *	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 
 Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on 
 enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 
 disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 
 global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 
 that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 
 against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 
 community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 
 subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 
 undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.
 
 *	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 
 statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 
 in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 
 American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 
 enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 
 the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 
 workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 
 change and dynamism of open markets.
 
 *	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 
 economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 
 widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 
 concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" 
 between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 
 International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 
 talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.
 
 *	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 
 and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 
 allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 
 types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 
 Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 
 work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 
 technologies.
 
 
 Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 
 greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 
 them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 
 global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 
 gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 
 emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 
 years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 
 to:
 
 *	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 
 international cooperation;
 
 *	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 
 the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 
 companies that can show real cuts;
 
 *	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 
 reductions;
 
 *	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 
 well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 
 while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;
 
 *	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 
 a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 
 by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 
 budget; and
 
 *	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 
 emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 
 resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 
 better path.
 
 
 VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 
 the Infrastructure of Democracy
 
 
 ""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 
 rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 
 must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
 Development Bank)
 March 14, 2002
 
 
 
 A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
 race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 
 all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 
 opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 
 U.S. international policy.
 
 Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 
 growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 
 to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 
 perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 
 spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 
 achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.
 
 Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 
 failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 
 for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 
 the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.
 
 This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 
 of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 
 impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 
 implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 
 of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 
 set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's 
 poorest economies within a decade.
 
 The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 
 achieve this goal:
 
 *	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 
 national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 
 development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 
 present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 
 these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 
 Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 
 in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 
 corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 
 in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 
 enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 
 countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 
 that have not to implement reforms.
 
 *	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 
 banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 
 comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 
 multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 
 the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 
 contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 
 contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 
 World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 
 Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 
 poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 
 in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 
 development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 
 productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 
 and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 
 must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 
 developing countries.
 
 *	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 
 assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 
 poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 
 more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 
 health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 
 better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 
 the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 
 results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 
 development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 
 development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 
 achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
 replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 
 system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 
 donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 
 achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 
 contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 
 World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 
 progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 
 that these institutions do.
 
 *	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 
 the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 
 is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 
 particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 
 ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
 agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 
 poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 
 sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 
 by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 
 banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 
 sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 
 development projects that show results.
 
 *	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 
 the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 
 most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 
 foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 
 as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 
 security strategy.
 
 *	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 
 countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 
 like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 
 threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 
 developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 
 governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 
 local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 
 global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
 and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 
 treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 
 twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 
 global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.
 
 *	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 
 democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 
 are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 
 will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 
 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 
 training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 
 technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 
 devastated by AIDS.
 
 *	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 
 including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 
 in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 
 Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 
 to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 
 suffer from hunger and malnutrition.
 
 
 VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 
 of Global Power
 
 
 ""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 
 century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 
 of prepare for war.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 West Point, New York
 June 1, 2002
 
 
 
 America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 
 broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 
 of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 
 clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 
 consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.
 
 There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 
 accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 
 and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 
 strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the 
 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 
 inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 
 security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 
 trade.
 
 The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 
 recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 
 first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 
 transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 
 new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 
 circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 
 highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 
 respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.
 
 The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 
 creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 
 mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:
 
 *	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 
 able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;
 
 *	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 
 combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;
 
 *	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 
 effective multinational fighting forces;
 
 *	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 
 scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 
 they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;
 
 *	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 
 meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 
 training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; 
 and
 
 *	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 
 we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.
 
 
 If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 
 partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 
 states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 
 perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 
 take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 
 same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 
 foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 
 close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 
 cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 
 transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.
 
 The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 
 Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 
 attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 
 dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 
 Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 
 levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 
 attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 
 alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 
 invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.
 
 The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 
 not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 
 ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 
 friendships, we will:
 
 
 *	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 
 global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 
 close defense and diplomatic cooperation;
 
 *	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 
 preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 
 the region over the longer-term;
 
 *	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 
 continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 
 we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;
 
 *	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 
 allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 
 environment; and
 
 *	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 
 institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
 forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 
 change in this dynamic region.
 
 
 We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 
 competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 
 internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 
 three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 
 global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.
 
 With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 
 on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and 
 Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 
 Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 
 critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 
 long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 
 States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 
 country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 
 needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 
 Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 
 Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.
 
 United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 
 refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 
 challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 
 global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 
 World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 
 promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 
 created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 
 cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 
 continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 
 former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 
 neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 
 into the Euro-Atlantic community.
 
 At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 
 divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 
 build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 
 motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 
 relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 
 democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 
 of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 
 weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 
 opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 
 decades.
 
 The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 
 relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 
 require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 
 democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 
 government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 
 have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 
 the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 
 in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.
 
 Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 
 and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 
 while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 
 India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 
 which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 
 with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 
 future.
 
 The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 
 strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 
 region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 
 China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 
 Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 
 features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 
 next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 
 In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 
 neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 
 path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 
 greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 
 the only source of that greatness.
 
 The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 
 China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 
 the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 
 peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 
 and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 
 similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 
 such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 
 welfare of our citizens.
 
 Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 
 more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 
 and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 
 political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 
 village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 
 one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 
 accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 
 remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 
 assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.
 
 Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 
 the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 
 opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 
 and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 
 $100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 
 the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 
 openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 
 protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 
 areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 
 self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 
 rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 
 commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 
 not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.
 
 The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 
 relations between the United States and other main centers of global 
 power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 
 in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 
 must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 
 become routine and unproductive.
 
 Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 
 can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 
 analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 
 that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open

 IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 
 Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century
 
 
 ""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 
 its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 
 and enterprise of our people.""
 
 
 
 
 
 President Bush
 Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
 September 20, 2001
 
 
 
 The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 
 different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 
 transformed.
 
 It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 
 We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 
 highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 
 our military must:
 
 *	assure our allies and friends;
 
 *	dissuade future military competition;
 
 *	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and
 
 *	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.
 
 
 The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 
 forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 
 strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 
 confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 
 deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 
 how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 
 occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 
 challenges.
 
 The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 
 symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 
 willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 
 the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 
 power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 
 many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 
 and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 
 well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 
 of U.S. forces.
 
 Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 
 planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 
 across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 
 of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 
 developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 
 strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 
 This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 
 ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 
 U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 
 infrastructure and assets in outer space.
 
 Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 
 approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 
 intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 
 technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 
 run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 
 Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 
 the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 
 wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 
 coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.
 
 We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from 
 experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 
 and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 
 whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 
 States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 
 sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 
 will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 
 military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 
 United States.
 
 Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 
 against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 
 around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 
 fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 
 with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 
 targets.
 
 We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 
 keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 
 appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 
 and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 
 capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 
 knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 
 the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 
 to maximize injury.
 
 We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 
 integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 
 the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 
 inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 
 information between intelligence and law enforcement.
 
 Initiatives in this area will include:
 
 *	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 
 to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 
 capabilities;
 
 *	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 
 seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 
 the nation and our allies;
 
 *	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 
 sustain our intelligence advantage;
 
 *	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 
 through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 
 capabilities; and
 
 *	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 
 government with all-source analysis.
 
 
 As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 
 America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 
 nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 
 sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 
 Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 
 other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 
 be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 
 and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 
 international politics must also extend their reach to understand 
 complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 
 health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.
 
 Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 
 wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 
 requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 
 police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 
 government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 
 cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 
 readiness to play our part.
 
 Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 
 to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 
 public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 
 about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 
 civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 
 a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 
 and this is an area where America must excel.
 
 We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 
 our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 
 by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 
 International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 
 to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 
 other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 
 cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 
 agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 
 implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 
 provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 
 personnel and officials.
 
 We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 
 right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 
 The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 
 war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 
 the American people.
 
 Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 
 diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 
 a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 
 and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 
 our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 
 vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 
 bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 
 As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 
 until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 
 is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 
 of it.
 
 In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 
 interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 
 apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 
 disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 
 our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow 
 such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with 
 our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.
 
 Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the 
 skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of 
 our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, 
 entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that 
 energy. That is where our national security begins.

 Cool --- I wasn't aware that the US had lifted it's population out of

 idea that the wealth gap is widening and deepening...

 Ubi China had always wanted to make a PC game for the local market, but a 
 number to factors kept the idea on hold. In January 2001, the right incentive 
 to motivate Ubi China to try a local project finally arrived: the license for 
 ""Music Up"", a popular animated property.

 I agree wholeheartedly.  It is easier to sit on knowledge than to
 continually acquire more on the frontiers.

 This is in fact very true.  People hate doing this for several reasons in
 my experience:
 1) ""Software changes.   Why waste time writing a FAQ now that will be out
 of date at the next release in 3 months?""
 2) ""This knowledge is specialized.  Only 4 people need to know this, and
 they already do.  If anyone else needs to know it they know who they can
 call.""
 The same engineers who give these excuses will spend eternities on the
 phone discussing this arcana and sharing the knowledge with anyone who has
 the patience to ask.
 
 The strongest contributors freely share everything they know whenever
 asked (or whenever they see the need for the information in the company)
 and who at the same time continue to generate new knowledge.
 
 Personal evaluation: my worth comes slightly lower on the scale in that I
 synthesize the knowledge from various personal sharing exercises into
 usable documents and messages for the company to employ.  This would seem
 like a marketing exercise except that Marketing is useless.   Useful
 knowledge sharing comes (IMHO) from engineering and sales.

 Pg 177:
 In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
 extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
 official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.
 
 Pg 92:
 The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
 meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
 informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
 as high as US$3,000.
 
 ==========
 
 I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
 correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
 in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
 participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

 French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)
 
 ==>
 
 The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
 which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
 in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
 conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
 of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
 whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
 paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
 not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
 country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
 between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
 under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
  
 
 --------------
 
 De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
 who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
 not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
 don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
 and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
 with a small section of people who know them personally.
 
 [1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that
 is the envy of most of the world.

 Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
 boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
 Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
 some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
 networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
 networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs <a href=3D""http://c=
 lickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D76-vJf7InBP3QcLqhr1okYP2r70U6iR"" ><B>doing
 something about it</b></a>. And what
 about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
 Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
 these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, <a href=3D""http://clickthru.onlin=
 e.com/Click?q=3D8b-SBGBQY0y_2bkiJ1EYIEElDh4B1FR"" ><B>show you how</b></a>.

 Big broadband providers are ticked off about Wi-Fi hot spots.
 In fact, both AT&amp;T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun
 campaigns to stop subscribers from sharing their accounts with
 others at no charge. Also this week: we review Yahoo""s new

 Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard
 about security issues, but should you count on their skills to
 ward off intruders? Not wise, says our ISP expert. In this

 Razor folks: is -lm documented anywhere?   BTW, I notice all my *.conf

 OTOH, look into DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse,

 It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than

 Let's limit the discussion to x86, to simplify.  There are some
 additional complications for some of the other architectures.
 (Essentially, they make most of the other architectures' ISO images
 available gratis, because they aren't selling boxed sets and want the
 public to have them anyway.  The ISOs include third-party proprietary
 apps, but of necessity not the highly-restricted ones available in 
 boxed set editions.)
 
 (1) You can get a single-disk ISO9660 image of SuSE ""evaluation""
 edition, version 7.0, _lots_ of places, including here:
 
 ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/evaluation-7.0/evaluation-7.0.iso
 
 (2) You could ""wget -r"" (or equivalent) the entire 8.0 FTP Edition (for
 lack of an official name for it) from here (or mirror sites):
 
 ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/
 
 Please note the restricted rights granted for use of the SuSE-originated
 YaST program specifically, stated here:
 
 ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/8.0/COPYRIGHT.yast
 
 A grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole 
 (apparently covering the FTP Edition and the Evaluation Edition) is
 stated here: ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/README.mirror-policy   Quoting:
 
      please make sure that you meet the following conditions if
      you intend to mirror ftp.suse.com:
 
    - SuSE Linux (YaST in particular) may not be reproduced on
      CDs or other media FOR VALUE. Reproduction for personal
      or educational use is explicitly allowed and encouraged.
 
 > I'm not sure on the details of it, but I think SuSE have
 > probably done an OpenBSD of the cd they sell?
 
 OpenBSD Foundation assert a compilation copyright over the OpenBSD
 official ISO9660 image.  A compilation copyright is the copyright
 monopoly that, for example, the editor of a set of third-party short
 stories receives.  Even though he didn't write any of the constituent
 stories, he put creative work into selecting, arranging, and editing
 those stories.  The law recognises such efforts as creative works
 deserving copyright protection, if there is sufficient creative effort.
 (A judge would decide, if someone made a court case of it.)  Courts have
 held, on the other hand, that arrangement and publication of
 alphabetical telephone listings in a ""yellow pages"" telephone directory
 (the advertising section) don't have anywhere near enough creative
 content to support an overreaching telco's claim of compilation
 copyright.  (The court politely said ""Nice try"", in effect.)
 
 The OpenBSD Foundation's claim may be a bit of a legal bluff, too.
 Theoretically, one could get around it by creating a slightly different
 set of ISO9660 images, thereby finessing the claim of compilation
 copyright.  But nobody bothers, because OpenBSD Foundation actually 
 charges only a very reasonable price for jewel-case sets, and nobody
 wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from Theo & co.
 
 I've never seen any claim from SuSE of compilation copyright on its ISOs
 or distribution as a whole.

 Again, the ""FTP Edition"" and the Evaluation Edition may be redistributed
 more-or-less freely, as long as it's not ""for value"".  (Ditto the
 ""live-eval"" edition, which is a demo only.)  The three boxed sets'
 contents may not.

 I think my mail wasn't very clear ;-) My point was that we should continue 
 releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on 
 this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch 
 everytime we have a bunch of new rules.
 
 A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced 
 (eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules 
 are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But 
 currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in 
 his setup (like -F going away). So if we say ""the branches are stable to 
 the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out 
 when you update to a new minor version number"", users and sysadmins could 
 be less reluctant to update.
 
 All just IMHO :o)

 Forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job. I tracked them
 down, they dont exist anymore, like 99% of the things I track down the req's
 are pulled or there is a freeze.
 
 The real problem is you cant even train for jobs now, since they _demand_
 7-10 years at a job paid to do the wierd collection of skills they want.
 
 But I'll get lucky eventually and someone I know will be a hiring manager.

 Be amazed - I've never bought anything online since an almighty cock up

 all the dosh I'd paid them and had no books to show for it either. Had
 it been the UK branch I'd have had them in the small claims court
 quicker than you could drop LOTR on your foot and say ""ouch"", but as it
 was the US branch I'd just no comeback.

 It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
 only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
 What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
 still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
 executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
 government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
 officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
 and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
 Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
 from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
 can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
 the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
 it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
 this may hold true for other European countries as well.  
 
 After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
 thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.

 Boy, that is rather strange. I've always been under the impression that
 the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the Forest Service's
 long-standing ""10:00 A.M. policy"", in place until the decision in 1963 to
 switch over to ""let-it-burn"".
 
 The 10:00 A.M. policy was based on theories about forest management from
 Europe, and wasn't as applicable to the American wilds. So, we went from a
 policy of containment for 100 years to one of letting things burn unless they
 directly threatened property.
 
 40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff
 left to burn. I can't imagine that artificially planted replacement
 forests, with dense stands of identical trees, help that much either. 
 
 I would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors
 squarely with the Forest Service. I would put the blame for many burned homes
 upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of
 materials, location, and landscaping.

 This was poking fun of the practice of making
 up differnt types of speech with different
 types of protected status.  I think the
 laws specialing out hate and protected speech
 are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
 is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
 I agree, they are all speech and should be 
 covered by the First Amendment, but
 
 If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
 states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
 only two answers and one of them is wrong.
 
   1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
      have a different level of protection dictated
      by whoever's offended at the time.
   2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
      A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
      any reasonable person. 
 
 Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really ""threat"".  I think
 they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
 in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
 money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
 don't like.

 Yes, it is.  You just want to be called a liberal when you really
 aren't.

 I actually thought of this kind of active chat at AOL (in 1996 I think), 
 bringing up ads based on what was being discussed and other features. 
 For a while, the VP of dev. (now still CTO I think) was really hot on 
 the idea and they discussed patenting it. Then they lost interest. 
 Probably a good thing.

","
 No I was just a little confused because I'm running procmail on a gateway
 and sits between the external sendmail box and internal exchange bridgehead
 server.  So there isn't any delivery to the local system.
 
 The only email it gets is inbound at the moment and we're looking to get rid
 of complication and go back to two boxes.  I did a test which looked like
 you guys are right about procmail, but testing is very limited due to the
 config I currently have.  It's just confusing when set up as a gateway.

 Using procmail, SpamAssassin doesn't get called for outgoing email
 (messages sent to other machines). 
 Procmail=Local Delivery Agent => inbound traffic to LOCAL machine.

 That's done by bero - not too sure whether it works on
 DVD+RW drives, I believe it supports only DVD-R.
 
 Would be nice to have a unified tool for DVD/CD
 burning - already I do my CD burning from dvdrecord
 since it is more recent.

5530,"Subject: GPL limits put to a test
","
 XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a
 company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,
 divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very
 gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to
 put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.
 
 Some notes from other places....
 
 >>From Doom9 [3]
 ""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4
 Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.
 Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers
 have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those
 who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -
 which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it
 under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma
 codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen
 code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only
 disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once
 again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today
 nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public
 in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince
 Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has
 been resolved XviD development will not continue.
 
 That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about
 the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.
 Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors
 first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes
 and kept quiet about the matter at hand.
 
 [Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of
 the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.
 However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release
 makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we
 might be hearing more about this.
 
 [Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it
 also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD
 doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides
 with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before
 downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd
 fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with
 Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX
 compatible as it was advertised.
 
 [Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma
 source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The
 license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and
 install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now
 clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)
 that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the
 copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and
 replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you
 can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright
 statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on
 your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken
 from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different
 copyright notices which is quite funny.""

 *Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
 By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>
 Staff Writer, CNET News.com
 August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
 http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
 <http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>
 
 *WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
 would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
 surveillance by police and spy agencies.*
 
 A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
 released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
 Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
 right to be anonymous online.
 
 The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
 <http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
 <http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
 in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
 conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
 draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
 early 2003.
 
 Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
 Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
 combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
 these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
 Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
 <http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
 process of considering.
 
 If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
 possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
 providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
 permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
 electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
 most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
 agents to conduct Internet monitoring.
 
 Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
 Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
 endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
 <http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
 drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
 Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
 <http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
 or ratified, the treaty.
 
 Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
 University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
 justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
 weak.
 
 ""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
 changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
 make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
 argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
 make that case.""
 
 Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
 powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
 number of cases where police have run into problems.""
 
 Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
 compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
 their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
 orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
 <http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
 applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.
 
 ""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
 Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
 capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
 security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
 responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.
 
 Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
 <http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
 the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
 proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
 just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
 only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
 <http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
 the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
 does not adequately respect privacy rights.
 
 Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
 of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
 personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
 implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
 providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
 the draft says.
 
 Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
 activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""
 
 ""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
 mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
 anonymously,"" Hosein said.
 
 A representative for George Radwanski 
 <http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
 the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
 the paper as it stands.""
 
 Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
 <mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.

 FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION
 BELOW AND
 YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
 TRUE,
 GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list
 below =====
 
 For each report, send $5 CASH, THE
 NAME & NUMBER
 OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING
 and YOUR E-
 MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose
 name appears ON THAT LIST next to the
 report. MAKE
 SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON
 YOUR
 ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case
 of any mail
 problems.
 
 === When you place your order, make sure
 you order each of
 the 5 reports.  You will need all 5 reports so
 that you can save
 them on your  computer and resell them.
 YOUR TOTAL
 COST $5 X 5=$25.00.
 
 Within a few days you will receive, vie e-
 mail, each of the 5
 reports from these 5 different individuals.
 Save them on your
 computer so they  will be accessible for you
 to send to the
 1,000's of people who will order them from
 you. Also make a
 floppy of these reports and keep them on
 your desk in case
 something happens to your computer.
 
 IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of
 the people who
 are listed next to each report, or their
 sequence on the list, in
 any way other than what is instructed
 below in step '' 1
 through 6 '' or you will loose the majority of
 your profits.
 Once you understand the way this works,
 you will also see
 how it does not work if you change it.
 Remember, this
 method has been tested, and if you alter, it
 will NOT work !!!
 People have tried to put their
 friends/relatives names on all
 five thinking they could get all the money.
 But it does not
 work this way. Believe us, we all have tried
 to be greedy and
 then nothing happened. So Do Not try to
 change anything
 other than what is instructed. Because if
 you do, it will not
 work for you.
 
 Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports,
 take this
 advertisement and REMOVE the name &
 address of the
 person in REPORT # 5. This person has
 made it through the
 cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
 2.... Move the name & address in
 REPORT # 4 down TO
 REPORT # 5.
 3.... Move the name & address in
 REPORT # 3 down TO
 REPORT # 4.
 4.... Move the name & address in
 REPORT # 2 down TO
 REPORT # 3.
 5.... Move the name & address in
 REPORT # 1 down TO
 REPORT # 2
 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the
 REPORT # 1
 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy
 every name &
 address ACCURATELY!

 To assist you with marketing your business
 on the internet, the
 5 reports you purchase will provide you with
 invaluable
 marketing information which includes how
 to send bulk e-
 mails legally, where to find thousands of
 free classified ads
 and much more. There are 2 Primary
 methods to get this
 venture going: METHOD # 1: BY
 SENDING BULK E-MAIL
 LEGALLY
 
 ===============================
 =============
 
 Let's say that you decide to start small, just
 to see how it goes,
 and we will assume You and those
 involved send out only
 5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that
 the mailing receive
 only a 0.2% response (the response could
 be much better but
 lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many
 people will send out
 hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of
 only 5,000 each).
 Continuing with this example, you send out
 only 5,000 e-
 mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
 10 orders for report #
 1. Those 10 people responded by sending
 out 5,000 e-mail
 each for a total of 50,000. Out of those
 50,000 e-mails only
 0.2% responded with orders.
 That's=100 people responded and ordered
 Report # 2.
 
 Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
 each for a total of
 500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to
 that is 1000 orders for
 Report # 3.
 
 Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails
 each for a total of 5
 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response
 to that is 10,000
 orders for report #4.  Those 10,000 people
 send out 5,000 e-
 mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50
 million) e-mails. The
 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
 Report  # 5.
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5
 EACH=$500,000.00
 (half million).
 
 Your total income in this example is: 1.....
 $50 + 2..... $500 +
 3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000
 ....... Grand
 Total=$555,550.00
 
 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL
 & PAPER AND
 FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
 RESPONSES AND
 NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT,
 YOU WILL
 STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
 
 ===============================
 =============
 
 REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS
 ASSUMING ONLY 10
 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU
 MAILED TO.
 Dare to think for a moment what would
 happen if everyone or
 half or even one 4th of those people mailed
 100,000e-mails
 each or more? There are over 150 million
 people on the
 Internet worldwide and counting. Believe
 me, many people
 will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 :
 BY PLACING
 FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

 Advertising on the net is very very
 inexpensive and there are
 hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
 Placing a lot of free ads
 on the Internet will easily get a larger
 response. We strongly
 suggest you start with Method # 1 and

 ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her
 when the thing didn't
 work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3

 received 50 responses. Within the next 45
 days she had
 received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all

 DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
 ByScott Tyler Shafer
 August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
 
 DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
 specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
 process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
 hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
 according to company officials.
 
 The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a
 
 family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The
 
 DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
 called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
 data.
 
 According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
 conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
 proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
 businesses.
 
 ""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
 ""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
 
 Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up
 
 to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
 application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
 alternative.
 
 In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
 importance in the world of XML.
 
 ""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
 said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
 Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
 
 Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
 security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
 
 According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
 processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company
 
 itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
 and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
 creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
 
 ""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
 adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
 said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
 technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
 will be mostly false.
 Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
 accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,
 
 while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes
 
 and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
 
 The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of
 
 XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
 as they pass through the device.
 
 The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
 balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
 and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
 
 In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application
 
 co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
 control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
 controls the device.
 
 DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
 Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in
 
 May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
 focus on content processing and acceleration.
 The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
 company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
 field trails at a number of other enterprises.
 
 ========================================================================
 =
 
 DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
 founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
 foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
 would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
 grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
 designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
 requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
 interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
 is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
 
 Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
 developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
 and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
 2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
 industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
 
 Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
 network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
 Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of
 
 products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
 providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
 industry-leading customers and partners.
 
 DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
 brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,
 
 drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
 Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

 DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding
 
 Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer
 
 in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services
 
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
 leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
 that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
 this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
 Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
 and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of

 DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and
 
 sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.
 
 Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML 
 networkingdevices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions
 
 at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
 and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on 
 its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.
 
 ""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
 intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
 prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
 DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
 XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
 applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
 Technology.
 
 ""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web
 
 services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single
 
 DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
 processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
 addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
 protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
 e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
 between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
 
 ""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
 laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
 a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
 Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
 DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
 free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
 performance and security pitfalls.""
 
 ""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly
 
 growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
 security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on
 
 their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
 Generation Three (XG3)technology was quite simply the single most 
 compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
 
 ""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
 about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
 developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
 services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
 XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely
 
 on XML for mission critical applications.""

","How are you doing?
 
 If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
 EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
 - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
 equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
 either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
 weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.
 
 You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
 miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
 my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
 so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
 to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
 the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
 as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
 to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
 at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
 
 I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
 and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
 the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
 does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
 I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
 absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
 
 If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
 any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
 then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
 
 You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
 actually work?""
 
 Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
 is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
 weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 
 
 Here is the bottom line ...
 
 I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
 exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
 Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
 to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my
 pledge to you.

"
2367,"Subject: Your eBay account is about to expire!
","Hi,
 
 I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
 I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
 $250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?
 
 In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
 it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...
 
 You've probably heard stories about people making
 whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
 were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
 boy-geniuses.
 
 Well, grasshopper, think again ...
 
 It's people like you and me that are making the real
 money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!
 
 Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
 entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.
 
 Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
 like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
 financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
 work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
 technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.
 
 If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
 you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
 DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
 You might not want their product, but remember that 
 thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
 percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
 makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
 guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
 review some numbers ...
 
 If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
 dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
 auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
 couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
 over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
 SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
 at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
 ZERO!
 
 Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
 hardly anyone sees your ad!
 
 Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
 profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
 an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
 in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
 generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
 of work.  
 
 It's that simple ...
 
 All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
 THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.
 
 The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
 matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
 using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
 executive working from an office building in New 
 York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
 bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
 it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
 and some basic familiarity with the Internet.
 
 I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
 ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
 started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
 the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
 opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
 I bought my own home - with CASH.  
 
 You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
 You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
 whatsoever is required.  
 
 If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
 you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
 So what are you waiting for?!
 
 I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
 YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
 will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.
 
 Here goes ...
 
 Do you have basic experience with the web? 
 Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
 Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
 Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
 complete financial freedom?  
 
 If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
 making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
 home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
 the 9-5 daily grind!
 
 All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
 is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
 to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
 it.
 
 You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
 Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
 how to start your first email campaign and how to
 build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
 orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.
 
 Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?
 
 No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
 products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
 starting an Internet business because they have 
 nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
 After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
 product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
 not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
 seven days. In fact ...
 
 I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
 bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
 the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
 to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
 where else will you find that level of service?!
 
 I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
 your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
 Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
 routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
 instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
 example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
 The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
 list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
 very first campaign is ready to go.
 
 As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
 of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
 email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
 include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
 if you order NOW!
 
 Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
 classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
 never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
 on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
 What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
 to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
 you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
 extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! 
 
 Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.  
 I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a

 I don't know from Pyzor, but I've always thought that the way services like
 Razor and DCC could be truly useful is if there were a bunch of different
 ones. We can assign them scores based on how trustworthy each one is, and
 when a message is listed in multiple services you can pretty much trust that

 Loo rolls of honour and the invisible man
 
 Paper Clips: A round-up of the weekly press
 
 By Steven McCaffery
 
 The powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an 
 ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
 for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
 Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
 originated in the Middle East.
 
 ""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.
 
 ""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""
 
 It is then explained: ""He had paid 625 to a local sorcerer and 
 believed that he was invisible.""
 
 In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.
 
 ""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
 three walls to steal 10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
 attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.
 
 ""The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
 next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
 between the back hallway and the front shop.
 
 ""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
 drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
 contents.""
 
 The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
 left in his store and is quoted as saying: ""On Monday morning when my 
 wife was opening, everything looked normal.
 
 ""But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
 shop next door.""
 
 The paper reports that the shop was the target of ""another well 
 organised crime"" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.
 
 The shop's owner says: ""The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
 people are going to be open to this.""
 
 The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
 Down Democrat.
 
 Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
 authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.
 
 He is shocked at reports of the ""wanton destruction by vandals"" and 
 issues a call for action.
 
 ""The time has come to fight fire with fire,"" he writes, ""before 
 unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
 using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
 sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.""
 
 As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
 controlled violence.
 
 ""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
 birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""
 
 Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
 liberal who may oppose his plan.
 
 ""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
 the order of the day.
 
 ""You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
 being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
 punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
 the late 1980s.
 
 ""However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
 faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
 it numerically passes Christianity.""

  Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
  Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing
 
 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
 Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
 of 
 desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.
 
 Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
 Technology, Inc. today
 announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
 e-security. This strategic
 partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
 protocol used by every e-based
 desktop, laptop and server. 
 
 Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
 Technology's award-winning Magi
 Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
 encryption to every
 Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
 between workgroups within and
 beyond the enterprise.
 
 Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
 network infrastructures. This
 combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
 security tools for each desktop
 application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
 can now be rapidly, easily and
 securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
 partners and clients without concern
 in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
 highly securely with strong
 encryption and authentication across firewalls.
 
 ""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
 Bernard Hulme, chairman and
 CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
 managers with added
 assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
 peer-to-peer computing""
 
 Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
 interoperability between
 partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA
 ClearTrust Web access
 management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.
 
 The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
 and advertising, be listed in
 RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
 It will also lead to joint
 marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
 joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
 business continuity support.
 
 ""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
 products and streamlining the
 deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
 combining our products,
 enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""
 
 About Magi
 Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure
 inter- and intra-enterprise
 collaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for
 collaboration very rapidly and
 affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this
 by effectively transforming
 unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through
 the use of such features as
 cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name
 spaces generating ""follow me URLs""
 for mobile professionals.

                                time for a snooze
 
          There comes a time in every August when news services should
          just shut the hell up, because the weather's too hot or too
          underwater, and the world grows so dull and hazy that even
          the overexcitable hardcore at LinuxWorld wander around like
          it's Undead Expo 2002, and the Weiss-baked Macintoxins can
          barely lift their wallets for MacOS X.2, and Sun can't be
          bothered to do anything but run s/RedHat/Sun Linux/g on a
          free distribution disk, and everyone else is on holiday, or
          getting ready to be on holiday, or being told that perhaps
          they should take a holiday RIGHT NOW, and all we can do is
          look at this awful, awful EUCD legislation and stare out the
          window until dawn.
 
          Yeah, it's our annual no news edition. We moved to a faster
          server. Do take the rest of the weekend off in celebration.
 
          Or, alternatively, build up a head of overexcitement for
          the public appearance of THOMAS DOLBY - the ""Hyperactive""
          chart artist and Beatnik audio plug-in advocate who, even as
          you read this, appears to be hosting a 350 Euro-per-head
          seminar on COMPOSING POLYPHONIC RING TONES at Helsinki's
          Radisson Royal Hotel in Finland. Lucky delegates will learn
          about ""using real-time MIDI controllers for tweaked
          effects"", ""techniques for making little speakers sound huge""
          and - perhaps most distressingly - ""picking the right
          instrument and register for best audibility"". The
          cacophonous cavalcade comes to London's Soho House on Tue
          and Wed next week if you'd like to check it out for
          yourself - or perhaps hold a street protest on behalf of
          music lovers worldwide.

          Dijkstra finally gone? Great. Now we can hang out with those
          sloppy little unrigorous languages he never let into the

          SMALLTALK, that dirty treat-me-like-an-object ducky. Version
          2.0b sprouts HTML-embedding and experimental MySQL support -
          implying you might actually be able to do something useful
          with it. Admittedly, ""useful"" has not been a word  much used
          in the Smalltalk community recently. Many of the current
          addicts seem to live entirely in the pleasuredomes of that
          Land of Infinite Fun, Alan Kay's Smalltalk sequel SQUEAK,
          the cross-platform UI-kablooie playground which, over time,
          been overloaded with more ill-fitting metaphors than this
          sentence. But even Squeak is showing signs of returning to
          planet Earth. Talk of cleaning up the object tree are rife;
          coders are working on XP-alike skins (instead of Squeak's
          peculiarly homely interface right now). There's even word of
          a SmallTalkish scripting language in the offing. And all

          Cadbury's Caramel is rubbish, and Jammie Dodgers not a patch

          ""M&M"" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but
          ""special miniaturised ones"", which he describes as ""frozen
          solid"" and ""might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
          chocolate flavour they impart"". While, following last week's
          announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
          reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
          of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a ""Fear
          Factor"" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating
          ""dirt and spiders"": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520
          ... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed
          with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, ""tasted of plastic...
          [resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
          by now""), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
          CHOC LIMITED EDITION (""Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
          which I never liked because of the thick chocolate""), and the
          whole point of that controversial ""It's not for girls""
          campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)
          as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other
          treats to look forward to in coming weeks: Cola-flavoured
          CADBURY-TREBOR REFRESHERS, chicken-wings-flavoured HULA HOOPS,
          bacon QUAVERS, the (presumably) non-crisp-like GOLDEN WONDER
          FRUIT WONDERS - or, indeed, any of this weird new American
          stuff: http://www.candyusa.org/Press/New/ace2002.shtml ,
          ranging from SCORNED WOMAN CHOCOLATE JALAPENO FUDGE to SOFT
          AND CHEWY STINKY FEET (""Mmm, these feet are *so* stinky"")...

","thx for the thoughts gentlemen (yes as someone said i use terms loosely) -
 
 more than cool --->
 
 quality: snobs only care about mpixels. this is about communications.  the
 general public cares about speed not quality.  how is akamai doing these
 days? not to mention any other QOS businesses that come to mind.
 
 implementation: point about hooking to usb, wires, etc. AGREE 100%. these
 implementations are super clunky, attachable camera needs to be integrated a
 la nokia model.  basically useless until better handsets are released i
 think.
 
 adoption: ian brought up the 'fax' problem.  brilliant thing is, this is far
 more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in
 family packs etc. but yes, the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network
 efx.
 
 content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content
 is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users
 communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
 half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
 cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.
 
 display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
 know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?
 
 misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
 thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
 resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
 had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
 and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
 decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
 photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
 didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
 greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
 traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
 SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.
 
 ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
 just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..
 
 You're right. Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last
 night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""
 If I wanted to share pictures with someone, I'd email them to them,
 where they could see them on a 1024x or 1600x display, instead of

 Remote realtime streaming video is neat, but sharing pictures? You invoke
 big words rather readily.

 I wonder if it is possible to reverse-engineer the Reed-Solomon 
 error-correcting codes to create a bytestream such that, when burned 
 onto a CD, you can make out a picture in the diffraction pattern?
 
 I suppose this is a modern equivalent to line-printer artwork; I was 
 imagining using a CD-RW drive to use the outer track, say, to spell out 
 the disc title, creation time, etc. It would sure beat feeding CDs 
 through a laser printer :-)

 That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo
 records with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB.  Such records
 aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of
 UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted
 before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.
 
 In part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the
 database is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk(), and part
 due to plain evil gremlins.

 This is called ""pseudo-packages"" or ""meta-packages"" and Debian has been
 using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty
 packages.
 
 Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally
 although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like
 them. For me it's more of an ugly ""hack"" than anything else, and I'd
 approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire
 categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages.
 
 Also, you can trivially do ""apt-get install <metapackage>"", but removing
 all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a
 trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.

 Subject: REVOLUTION OS is now authorized for UC Santa Cruz screening
 
 To all,
 
 I have read the series of e-mails related to the unauthorized UC Santa
 Cruz screening that was scheduled for June 1.  I sincerely appreciate
 IEEE's good faith effort to correct the mistake.
 
 Consequently, so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend
 the screening, I want to give IEEE and SlugLUG permission to screen
 REVOLUTION OS at 1 PM on June 1.  I would ask the members of SVLUG to
 hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that I am
 trying to get REVOLUTION OS booked into the Camera 3 in San Jose, and I
 would prefer that SVLUG's members have a chance to see a nice 35mm print
 of the film.  If my distributor is unable to book the film into a
 theater in the Bay Area, I promise that I will work with SVLUG to
 quickly set up a screening for its members.
 
 I realize there may be some members of SlugLUG who are unhappy that I
 originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of
 REVOLUTION OS.  There are several reasons why I made the request, and
 none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk.  
 
 One SlugLUG member commented that it was odd that a movie about the Open
 Source movement would not be available for open viewings.  Another
 SlugLUG member remarked that my request smacks of Bill Gates's Open Letter
 to Hobbyists.  
 
 The bottomline is that I did make a film about the Open Source movement,
 but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself Open
 Sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch.  If I made a movie about
 the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean I'm a
 vegetarian.  
 
 I simply thought Open Source and Free Software were compelling subjects
 worth exploring and documenting.  As a result, I came to admire many
 aspects of the Open Source movement and chose to focus the documentary
 on the movement's positive history.  However, I do not think I should be
 punished for telling the story of Free Software and Open Source by
 having my intellectual property misappropriated.   More practically, my
 feelings about Open Sourcing REVOLUTION OS are abundantly clear when you
 see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the film's credits.  
 
 I realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a TV airing
 is considered fair use.  I believe in a healthy fair use doctrine. 
 However, there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at
 home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a
 university campus.  So I freely admit my objection to unauthorized
 screenings of REVOLUTION OS does echo Bill Gates's letter.  Personally, I
 believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should
 retain the choice to Open Source their IP.  If the Open Source movement
 is not voluntary then it is really just piracy.
 
 One of the reasons I am concern with unauthorized group screenings of
 the film, is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin
 selling VHS copies of the film for educational/institutional use with a
 license permitting noncommercial large group screenings.  We hope to use
 the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the
 DVD.  I want to release the DVD as soon as possible, but I cannot afford
 to take on anymore REVOLUTION OS-related debt.  Thus the importance of
 preserving the educational/institutional market.
 
 Frequently, I will read comments on Slashdot and other mailing lists
 that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the
 artists and only hurts the greedy record labels.  Well, in the case of
 REVOLUTION OS there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish. 
 It's just me.  I made and financed the film on my own.  I have worked
 full-time for almost three years without a salary.  The only way I will
 get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek
 out legal opportunities to view REVOLUTION OS.
 
 I truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the Open Source community for
 REVOLUTION OS, and I am grateful that people do want to see it.  If you
 will just bare with me, I will figure out a way for all interested
 persons to legally view it.
 
 I hope the dust up over the unauthorized, and now authorized, screening
 at UC Santa Cruz has not inconvenienced anyone.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 J.T.S. Moore
 Director, REVOLUTION OS

 You can't, because there isn't one, yet.  Habeas is using a 
 combination of copyright and trademark law to protect their 
 sender warranties.  They hope to patent the system, but they 
 have not been ISSUED a patent.

 I downloaded and played with it a bit, but had no time to do anything
 systematic.  It correctly recognized a spam that slipped through SA.
 But it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any
 MIME structure or HTML parts, and several messages in my saved 'zope

 So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).

 Hmmm... I don't see any :-)
 
 My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
 Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
 upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
 Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for
 me) ;-)
 Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
 wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a
 secondary rebuild system.

 >
 A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? 
  Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.
 B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit 
 acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and 
 people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive 
 expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less 
 sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke 
 the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of 
 society.
 C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also 
 aren't 'found in the wild'.
 
 (By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that 
 there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized 
 behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). 
  The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 
 40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious 
 conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)
 
 D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or 
 less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated 
 by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article 
 pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical 
 integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, 
 government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage 
 of British conquest, but who doesn't?)
 
 (I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)
 http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=true
 http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true
 
 'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and 
 cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and 
 religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, 
 and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part 
 of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or 
 nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.
 
 
 In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the 
 Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But 
 violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling 
 the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both 
 sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by 
 far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united 
 Ireland
 
 The provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were 
 killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern 
 Ireland understatement, as ""The Troubles.""'

 Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast 
 amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not 
 only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected 
 need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work 
 together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to

  o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
    a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
  o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
    about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
    just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
    when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
    time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
  o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
    I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
    listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
    to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
    row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
    about two dozen third world countries. 
  o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
    about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
    you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
  o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
    enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
    automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
    go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
    of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
  o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
  o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due

    is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their

 that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
 automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
 average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  
 
 So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
 business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
 and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
 working all that well.

 SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
 BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)
 
 Dear Sir, 
 
 I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
 Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
 Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
 this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
 of both of us. 
 
 The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
 lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
 late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
 money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
 personal belongings and as such the security company does 
 not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
 originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
 Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
 with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
 before he died of cardiac arrest.
 
 As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
 an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
 consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
 affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
 to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
 consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
 and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
 Terrorist fund.
  
 If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
 me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
 expenses, and 75% for us.
 
 You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
 name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
 that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
 also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
 of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
 consignment.
 
 Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
 communication
  
 Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
 requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
 (seven) working days.
 
 I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
 my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
 mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 
 
 Best regards, 
 Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

 Well, DUH!!!
 
 It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
 precisely identical between males and females.
 
 Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.

 Im using the standard ADSL package
 With the speedtouch usb modem
 
 I have a 3 machine network(it was a 4 machine till my laptop crapped out)
 Anyway
 I have a dedicated linux server running debian 3.0 with the ADSL modem
 plugged directly into it.
 I have a 5 port switch connecting the home net, all have their own 10/100 nic.
 The server runs my firewall/net gateway/etc.
 And I have some firewall rules for masquerading

 Once the machine is configured for adsl  (thats the tough bit)
 the network stuff is quite easy.
 
 I found that to be the simpelst way to go.

     A federal judge has determined that gas pipline manager El Paso did indeed 
     limit natural gas supplies to California, resulting in ruinous prices, 
     rolling blackouts, and smug Cato Institute flaks wagging their fingers at 
     hot-tubbers and environmentalists. 
 
     California was sitting on a juicy dotcom-era tax windfall before it all got

 Hm, it is built inside the same chroot.  aviplay works (well it would if I 
 had XV, I get X errors ;)).  But it doesn't complain about linker 
 problems.  So I suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok.
 
 Sigh, avifile is one of the worst packages out there, in all aspects - 
 naming of tarballs, not ever releasing an actual package, versioning of 
 libraries, API stability, ...

","Looks and sounds a hell of a lot like Clare's cat, Violence...
 
 A tall tail or is it a prowling panther?
 
 
 http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html
 
 
 Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
 The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
 sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.
 
 Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
 Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
 in just four weeks.
 
 Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
 the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
 cameras captured it on film.
 
 The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
 two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.
 
 He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
 a hunter.
 
 ""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""
 
 The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
 been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
 of the sighting.
 
 His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
 of the large cat prowling through their garden.
 
 She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
 for it to get hurt.""
 
 Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
 usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
 that morning.
 
 He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
 might jump you.""
 
 Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
 Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.
 
 If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

 15 seconds is more than enough timeout... There's no request/minute limit,
 and we are not close to hardware limits on any of the servers.
 
 Could you send me relevant sections from the log file as well as
 your config?

 Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop
 
 Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality
 
 Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
 Tuesday October 8, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
 Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
 up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
 The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
 evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
 which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
 supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
 Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
 the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
 appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
 The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
 destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
 with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
 Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
 ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
 have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
 archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
 church.
 Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
 judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
 common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
 ""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
 Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
 down,"" it said.
 The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
 bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
 which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
 Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
 ""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
 It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
 called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
 allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
 Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
 church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
 appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
 appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
 He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
 formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
 Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
 society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
 small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
 alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
 is present.
 Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
 during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
 evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
 absence of a robust rebuttal.
 A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
 evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
 teaching.
 On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
 Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
 and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
 attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
 your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
 Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
 should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
 Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
 appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
 the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

2045,"Subject: [ILUG] Update on  PC Cases
","Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
 all. Thanks for your suggestions.
 
 Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
 fan.
 
 I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg133.86)
 but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
 It has 4 x 51/4"" drive bays and 6 x 3"" drive bays so I should be ok for
 future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
 on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
 off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
 screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
 off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
 different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
 is big and has loads of room inside.
 Oh... and it looks very cool :-)
 
 However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says
 
 * Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
 * ATX Power supply sold separately
 
 In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
 ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
 Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
 USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
 that show) but I missed that :-)
 
 I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
 (thanks Mike)
 
 So now I can code-in-peace...
 
 Justin

  See, the IDE subsystem is like the One Ring. It's kludginess, due to
 having to support hundreds of dodgy chipsets & drives means that it is
 inherintly evil. A few months of looking at the code can turn you sour.
 Years of looking at it will turn you into an arsehole.
 
  They haven't found a hobbit that can code, so mortal humans have to
 suffice.

2846,"Subject: Kill Your Gods
","Hindus mourn 'monkey god'
 
 
 By Omer Farooq
 BBC reporter in Hyderabad
 
 Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
 revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
 state of Andhra Pradesh.
 
 
 The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed
 
 Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
 after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.
 
 The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
 south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.
 
 It had not eaten for three weeks.
 
 Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
 the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
 monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.
 
 Garlanded
 
 One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
 failed because of the blind faith of the people.
 
 
 The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
 out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.
 
 The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
 ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
 as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.
 
 Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
 around the clock.
 
 'Exploited'
 
 Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
 the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
 residents.
 
 But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
 mistreated.
 
 They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
 forcibly confined in the temple.
 
 The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
 exploited to make money.
 
 The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
 villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

 I have a version that's working now. I'll try it a couple of days and 
 check it during daylight. Basically I added an agument to 
 ClearCurrent and updated all callers to slap in $ftoc(curLine). I 
 also flipped the order in  Msg_Change to ClearCurrent $prevline after 
 the Mh_SetCur. For some reason it barfs when Marking many messages 
 Unread. I'll check that tomorrow.
 
 G'night.

 All the world loves a smartass...
 
 :-).
 
 Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
 this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
 for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
 of slaves, who were brought here by force.
 
 More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.
 
 Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
 wealth has nothing to do with it.
 
 It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
 individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
 statistical sophistry.
 
 
 Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
 is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
 there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
 400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
 since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
 wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
 they're nowhere near the top.
 
 I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
 in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
 monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
 and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
 what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.
 
 In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
 distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
 economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
 people living longer.
 
 I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
 returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.
 
 Cheers,
 RAH

 Sure thing :)
 
 I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at
 build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a
 
 	rpmbuild --recompile <rpm> --without oss --without isapnp
 
 (I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard
 is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)).
 
 Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package
 installed.  I've added a flag ""kernsrc"", that also can be used
 --without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It
 would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist
 (/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm
 a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file
 not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way
 to do that.
 
 I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards
 option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found
 out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs 
 don't help much.
 
 
 Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of
 alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply
 the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules
 from source.  It created the /dev files and all.
 
 Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild
 the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec:
 
 rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp
 --without kernsrc
 
 But I get this:

       File listed twice: /dev/amidi
       Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
      /etc/makedev.d/00macros
      /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound
 ========================================================================
 
 Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand
 much of what's going on here.  The 00macros file is from the MAKEDEV
 rpm, and alsasound was supposed to be installed by alsa-driver, I think.
    It is not in the filesystem, anyway.
 
 I've looked in /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root, they are there in
 etc.  For 00macros I think the part that does it is this line
 in alsa-driver.spec:
 
 cp -a %{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/00macros /{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/
 
 And alsasound is installed by %{BUILDIDR}/Makefile.
 
 
 Oh, and I think I've forgot to mention, I'm running beta-null :).

5454,"Subject: Re: traceback in new exmh
","Oops - turns out i wasn't careful installing it, so the exmh(library)
 variable was pointing at my old installation.  I'm surprised it worked
 as well as it did.
 
 In any case, I removed the old library directory, and edited exmh,
 exmh-bg, exmh-strip, etc to point at the right one.  Now I'm getting
 another traceback on startup:
 
 can't read ""mhPriv(pubseq,family,cur)"": no such variable
     while executing
 ""MhSeq $folder $seq add $mhPriv(pubseq,$folder,$seq) [MhSeqExpand
 $folder $msgids""
     (procedure ""MhReadSeqs"" line 73)
     invoked from within
 ""MhReadSeqs $folder seqs""
     (procedure ""Mh_Sequences"" line 2)

     invoked from within

     (""after"" script)
 
 
 +family is the folder I was in when I quit exmh.
 
 I'm on a remote display right now, and its really slow.  I'll have to
 play with it more tonight when I get home to see if there are any
 other problems.

 <b>Microsoft reveals media XP details</b><br>
 <font size=""-1"">
 Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
 Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.

 Hewlett-Packard has shuffled employees out of its Jornada Pocket PC development unit in Singapore, as the company continues to cut costs following its merger with Compaq Computer.
 Jornada products are developed in Singapore and will be phased out by year's end, with the exception of Jornada 720, which resembles a mini-notebook. The model will eventually be rebranded as an HP iPaq device.

 CMP, owners of [0]The Perl Journal, have brought the journal back, in the
 form of an online monthly magazine, in PDF form. The subscription rate is
 $12 a year. They need 3,000 subscriptions to move forward (no word if
 existing subscriptions will be honored, or included in the 3,000).
 [0]Read the site for more details.
 
 I think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include ""a
 healthy dose of opinion"", as well a broadening of coverage including
 languages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms
 other than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it
 covered a wide variety of platforms).

 All things considered, I get that effect with Mailman, but the viable
 alternatives are ezmlm, which is loonware and I'm avoiding on principle,
 and majordomo, which seems to have stagnated. Oh, and there's apparently
 something called SmartList which is a bitch to set up.

 For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the

 I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its

5669,"Subject: IT ""fossils""
","While wandering through Uppsala, Sweden last week, I ran across the
 ""Keramik"" studio of Paula von Freymann. Her pottery work has the theme of
 ""fossils for the future"", and she has two main lines of this work. One is
 more conventional, taking leaves from plants at the nearby Linneas Gardens
 and impressing them into the clay before firing, leaving a ""fossil"" of the
 plant.
 
 The other is more unique, taking imprints of circuit boards, cellular
 telephones, punched cards, etc. and then firing the result to make ""IT
 fossils."" Given how quickly most of our work becomes obsolete, I found the
 offbeat notion of IT fossilization an oddly fitting way of archiving the
 physical detritus of the digital age.

 http://www.kuai.se/~itart/bildhtml/4.htm
 
 My guess is she'd gladly make fossils of any object you wanted, for a price.
 Could be an interesting memorial of your next product launch!

 SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA 
 BARR. WILLIAMS FALANA (SAN)
 
 Dear Sir, 
 
 I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar 
 Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World 
 Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce 
 this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit 
 of both of us. 
 
 The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was 
 lodged into a security company here in the Country by the 
 late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for safe-keeping. This 
 money was lodged in security vaults / boxes and labelled as
 personal belongings and as such the security company does 
 not know the true content of the boxes.This money was 
 originally meant to be used for his political campaign. 
 Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me 
 with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit 
 before he died of cardiac arrest.
 
 As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with 
 an offshore Security Company to move this money as a 
 consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore 
 affiliated office where you will be required to put claim 
 to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the 
 consignment. You should know that this business is safety 
 and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or 
 Terrorist fund.
  
 If you are interested to carry out this transaction with 
 me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
 expenses, and 75% for us.
 
 You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full 
 name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement 
 that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction 
 also which will be used to effect the change of ownership 
 of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the 
 consignment.
 
 Also send me your Telephone and Fax numbers for easy 
 communication
  
 Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above 
 requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 7 
 (seven) working days.
 
 I will be waiting for your urgent reply.You can reach me on 
 my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-
 mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com 
 
 Best regards, 
 Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}

 I've just got a few quick thoughts today.<p>
 
 First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome.<p>
 
 Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.<p>
 
 On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard, 
 <a href=""http://www.clevermedia.com/"" target=""_blank"">CleverMedia</a> is sponsoring karaoke night at <a href=""http://www.gnomedex.com/"" target=""_blank"">Gnomedex</a>. According to the woman with her finger on the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, ""There is definitely a 'surprise' in the works for the attendees ... "" Hmmm. Could it even compare to last year's Miss Gnomedex contest? I think it unlikely. In any regard, the folks at CleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun -- it's what they do for a living! Between <a href=""http://www.leoville.com/"" target=""_blank"">Leo Laporte</a>, <a href=""http://doc.weblogs.com/"" target=""_blank"">Doc Searls</a>, <a href=""http://www.grc.com/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Gibson</a>, <a href=""http://www.analogx.com/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Thompson</a>, <a href=""http://www.evhead.com/"" target=""_blank"">Evan Williams</a>, and too many others to mention, you'd be silly to miss out.<p>
 
 Onward. Have a great day.<p><p>

 <b>Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II</b><p>
 
 I don't want to mince any words, here. <a href=""http://www.codeweavers.com/ target=""_blank"">CodeWeavers</a> has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released <a href=""http://codeweavers.com/products/office/"" target=""_blank"">CrossOver Office</a> product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the <a href=""http://wine.codeweavers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Wine Project</a>. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.<p>
 
 Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and <a href=""http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/"" target=""_blank"">CrossOver Plugin</a> (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.<p>
 
 I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.<p>
 
 Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.<p>
 
 For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver.<p>
 
 Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.<p>
 
 A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.<p><p>

 <b>Kernel Configuration - Part X</b><p>
 
 Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.<p>
 
 There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.<p>
 
 See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.<p>
 
 Tomorrow, we <i>will</i> dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration.<p><p>

 Using Niall's example - single set of files but >1 namespace, and suppose that
 you want to delete some items from the set according to rules applied to the
 namespaces.  With soft links you need an *extra* namespace the others refer to,
 and after filtering the namespaces, you have to do a manual reference count to
 decide what goes and what stays.  With hard links, you just unlink and deletion
 is automatic.

 ***Updating Data Safely with A DataSet, by Alex Homer
 
 OK, so we cant store all three values for a row (the current, original
 and the underlying values) in the tables of our DataSet. Is this actually
 important? What do we actually need to perform the process, and what do
 users actually expect to see? Can we make do with just two values instead
 of three, (and dont you hate books that keep asking questions)?

 Author Interviews
 
 ***With Franois Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual
 Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook.
 
 [AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET
 developer, and so who do you think needs this book?
 
 [CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming
 tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is
 difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in
 finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that
 is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.
 
 [PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and
 regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are
 the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a
 great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the
 regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight
 in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work
 with when writing the book.
 
 [AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.

 ***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook
 
 In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET.
 There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out
 on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin
 Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on
 the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related
 topics.
 
 What is free threading? 
 
 Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an
 application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of
 threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those
 threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the
 developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should
 end, and what it should do while executing.

 ***C#Today Free Code Download
 
 Due to customer feedback, C#Today have decided to try out something new
 this week - we are making this week's code  download \ support material
 available to all non-subscribers (providing they are a member of the Wrox
 Developer Community, which is free to join).
 
 This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM 
 http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid026
 
 The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate
 source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET
 facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a
 complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel
 object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together
 these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to
 develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in
 code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which
 attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an
 existing C# or VB.NET project.
 
 
 ***Get on the Fast Track to Success
 
 If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core
 .NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for
 you.
 
 The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by
 providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts
 and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By
 targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to
 concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.

 <b>AUTHOR INTERVIEWS</b>
 <br>
 <br>
 - With <font color=""#CC0000""><b>Franois Liger, Craig McQueen</b></font> and <font color=""#CC0000""><b>Paul Wilston,</b></font> 
 authors of <a href=""http://www.wrox.com/ACON11.asp?ISBN=1861007302&tid027"">Visual Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook</a>
 <br>
 <br>
 <b>Q. What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET developer, and so who do you think needs this book?</b><br><br> 
 
 <font color=""#CC0000"">[CM]</font> The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. String manipulation is a 
 large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code 
 to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.<br> 
 
 <font color=""#CC0000"">[PW]</font> I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and regular expressions are 
 not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a 
 great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book 
 is worth its weight in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work with when writing the book.<br> 
 
 <font color=""#CC0000"">[AP]</font> In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET<br><br>

 <br><br>
 In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET. There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what 
 seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as 
 well getting his opinions on various programming-related topics.<br><br> 
 
 <b>Q. What is free threading?</b><br><br> 
 
 Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of 
 threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the developer 
 to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing.<br><br>

 <b>Get on the Fast Track to Success</b><br><br>
 
 If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core .NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for you. 
 The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts and 
 understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to 
 concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.<br><br>

 <br>
 Due to customer feedback, C#Today have decided to try out something new this week - we are making this week's code  download \ support material available to all non-subscribers 
 (providing they are a member of the Wrox Developer Community, which is free to join).<br><br>
 
 
 <b>This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM</b> 
 <a href=""http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid027"">http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid027</a>
 
 The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET facility and has 
 attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel object, which allows programmatic access to 
 hand-written code. Together these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs 
 in code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an existing C# or VB.NET project.<br><br>

 Anyone have a copy of Gill Sans or Bell Centennial I can borrow? I wonder if 
 I'll ever have $250 to spend on fonts. *Update:* Kevin Marks[1], who is 
 stupendously incredible for far more things than I can list here points out 
 that it's _included with OS X_. I knew Mac OS X included a lot of grat fonts[2]
 , but I don't know how I overlooked this. (Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay 
 you the two cents in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of 
 fonts.)

 Would reinitializing something here help, or does razor do that as needed
 anyway, and this just reflects trouble at the servers?
 
 Also, since these are reports I'm making from within Mutt, it's annoying
 that the error messages garble the X window a bit. If there's nothing
 constructive to do about razor failing, can I at least turn off the failure
 messages? One way or the other I'd rather not see them.

 This time around, we have _two, two, two_ Guestbloggers for the price of one. 
 Quinn Norton and Danny O'Brien have agreed to fill the sidebar slot for a 
 little while. Danny and Quinn and their rommie Gilbert are just about the most 
 fun Bay Areans I've had the pleasure of hanging out with. Between the three of 
 them, they're capable of being entertaining on the subjects of Python, 
 copyright, pottery, usability (a conversation with Quinn about usability made 
 it, almost verbatim, into my second novel ""Eastern Standard Tribe""), 
 load-balancing, free software, nerd culture, British cuisine, bodily ailments, 
 pregnancy... Well, you name it. I can't wait to see what they post! Discuss[1]

","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221
 Date: Not supplied
 
 The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
 Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
 the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
 findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 
 
     By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
     third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
     consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
     this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
     initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
     Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
     members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
     information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
     supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
     his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
     hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
     Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
     more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
     held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
     and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
     had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

 According to some old documentation (man exmh-ref)
 
      The mouse bindings for the folders labels are:
 
           Left - Change to folder.
           Middle - View nested folders.
           Right - Refile current messages to the folder.
           Shift-Right - Link current messages to the folder.
           Shift-Middle - Drag a folder label to some drop target.
           Control-Right - Clear the current target folder.
 
 It should be possible to link using shift-right-click the same way you 
 can move using only right-click.

 Wow. I think a majority of the anti-spam community out there would disagree
 with you. It makes no difference what the list is, whether it's run by ZDNet
 or Empire Towers, whether it uses open proxies and relays or a MLM like
 mailman or Lyris. In either case I was added to a list against my will to 
 receive unsolicited bulk email. I shouldn't have to 'just unsubscribe from
 the list' any more than I should have to send email with the subject REMOVE
 to removemeblahblah1234@yahoo.com or go to http://www.centralremovelist.com/
 to 'unsubscribe' from some viagra spam. Or are you advocating that as well?

 That's fine. But my point is that neither person in my example was
 committing an inherently untrustworthy act. Yet someone's TES would likely
 fall because of it.

 Hmm. Good point about razor-whitelist. I'd forgotten about that.

5439,"Subject: [Ximian Updates] libpng has a potential buffer overflow when loading progressive images
","Severity: Security
 Product: libpng
 Keywords: Red Carpet libpng buffer overflow
 URL: http://support.ximian.com/q?283
 References: 
 Release Notes for libpng 
 ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png-group/archives/png-list.200207
 
 libpng is a library used to create and manipulate PNG (Portable
 Network Graphics) image files.
 
 The 1.2.4* and 1.0.14 releases of libpng solve a potential buffer
 overflow vulnerability[1] in some functions related to progressive
 image loading. Programs such as mozilla and various others use these
 functions. An attacker could exploit this to remotely run arbitrary
 code or crash an application by using a specially crafted png image.
 
 These new releases also solve other minor bugs such as some memory
 leaks in reading image functions.
 
 Since most applications which display images use libpng, this affects
 many applications including Evolution and Mozilla. Additionally, Red
 Carpet links libpng statically and needs to be updated separately.
 
 Ximian only ships libpng on Solaris, and so we only have Solaris
 packages available. When distribution vendors update their packages,
 they will be available in Red Carpet. Please use Red Carpet to upgrade
 libpng to 1.0.14 and Red Carpet 1.3.4-2. You can also get packages
 from the Ximian FTP site:
 
 Solaris 7/8
 ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian-gnome/solaris-7-sun4/libpng-1.0.14-1.ximian.1.sparc.rpm

3849,"Subject: [ILUG] semaphores on linux RH7.3
","Hi All,
 
 I have a question which is a bit tricky and was
 wondering of anyone has come across this problem
 before or could point me in the right direction.
 
 I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to
 Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way
 semaphores  are being handled. The application uses
 mulitple processes to run application code with the
 main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o
 be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled
 via semaphores.
 
 In certain circumstances the main process and the
 application child process seem to lock up both waiting
 for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I
 have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that
 the semaphore code is doing the correct things for
 syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the
 semop() system call.
 
 I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay
 between changing semaphore states the problem goes
 away, but this causes our entire application to run
 really sloooww !! lol
 
 Is there anything weird or different with the standard
 implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could
 cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state
 
 in a semaphore immediately?
 
 Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==
 EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails
 (-1) also fixes the problem but again system
 performance goes down the toilet.
 
 both the parent controlling process run as the same
 uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with
 permissions 0666.
 
 Any pointers would be appreciated!
 
 Rgds,
 
 Colin Nevin

 I was puzzled at first, but I think I understand what happened.
 
 First, I approved the post because it didn't appear to be spam, even
 though it wasn't from a member.  I thought it was odd that someone
 wanted to send the MIME blurb to the list, but it was not really that
 different from causing the New York Times web site to send a story to
 the list.  (Except that the bits here are antediluvian, but old bits are
 a problem to be solved by social opporobrium, not technical constraints.)
 
 But I think what actually happened is that some idiot got infected by
 Klez and had both FoRK and the pine-robot autoresponder address in their
 mailbox or addressbook, so Klez forged mail from fork@xent.com to the
 autoresponder, which responded.  To FoRK.

 Has anybody on the list installed/used this distro? If so wouldn't mind a bit 
 of help.
 
  Burnt the ISO's from the latest Linux Format magazine. Took a couple of 
 attempts to install but got there. My problem - I have a standard dial-up 
 modem and the installation gives you the network card setup so internet 
 download is out of the question, but, I installed the Stage3 tarball which 
 puts the .tgz files on your harddrive. 
 
  So methinks, I have the software there and all I need to do is install so as 
 1) get the necessary programmes to connect to the net and 2) install any 
 other programmes I might need.
 
  What actually happens is that if, for example, I attempt to install the KDE 
 package, the system goes looking for any dependencies on the net despite the 
 fact that the dependencies reside on my hard drive. Obviously I can't install 
 anything.
 
  Have checked all docs on the web page and nothing deals with a standard 
 dial-up modem or how to tell the package manager to look for the dependencies 
 on the hard drive.
 
  Anybody able to help me here?
 
  Thanks in anticipation.

 If we had more variety of franchise food than the
 Wendys/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell/TimHorton's monopoly (they are all Pepsi
 under the hood, aren't they?), things might be different.  When a New

 croissant, we have a timbit ... because that's all we can buy.

 Perhaps more useful would be if Tim could check in the pickle(s?)
 generated by one of his training runs, so that others can see how
 Tim's training data performs against their own corpora.  This could
 also be the starting point for a self-contained distribution (you've
 got to start with *something*, and training with python-list data
 seems just as good as anything else).

 We in the game industry know what we mean when we say that a game is 
 ""addictive."" We think that quality in a game is a good thing: people like it, 
 they keep coming back to it, and they want to play it more and more. I agree 
 that it's a good thing. If a game has that quality, then it's probably a darn 
 good game. But using the word ""addiction"" to describe that quality does us no 
 favors with the general public.

2322,"Subject: Re: exmh bug?
","
 The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
 -> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
 being issued and the responses.
 
 FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
 encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
 window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
 asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
 dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).

 Yes it does. And if you're missing the dependencies needed for the selected
 options, you'll even be informed! (for ALSA, you'll need alsa-lib-devel for
 example)

 Yup... unfortunately the alsa-kernel needs to be rebuilt for each kernel,
 and there's no way of avoiding it.

  Why would a customer use `spamassassin -t` without understanding what it does?

 This topic comes up every so often on this list.  The short answer is 
 no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.
 
 The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
 job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.
 
 You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
 read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
 I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
 curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
 I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
 require a response.
 
 Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
 accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
 though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
 is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
 customizable.
 
 The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
 that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
 could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
 to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
 commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
 a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.

 Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him
 
 Rod Liddle
 Wednesday August 28, 2002
 The Guardian
 
 Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
 to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
 with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
 I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
 statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
 way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
 sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
 and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
 for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
 maybe me and you, too.
 But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
 Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
 happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
 proto-warriors in the background.
 You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
 Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
 covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
 mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
 we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
 off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
 British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
 arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
 off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
 thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
 we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
 to shut up.
 Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
 September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
 thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
 persecution.
 And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
 got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
 manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
 context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
 perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
 tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
 scoop.
 Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
 this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
 allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
 meant to do stuff like that.
 He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
 frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
 media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
 and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
 - repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
 true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
 Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
 turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
 The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
 revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
 government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
 dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
 and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
 An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
 overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
 One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
 (the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
 the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
 Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
 time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
 home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
 the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
 foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
 against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
 Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
 suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
 the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
 for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
 Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
 been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
 inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
 ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
 happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
 example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
 repellent.
 And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
 to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
 appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
 ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
 Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
 are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
 The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
 remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
 is simply the pungency of his views.
 It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
 rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
 is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
 You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
 if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
 unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
 not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
 up, therefore, won't make a difference.
 It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
 The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
 But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

","Hi all,
 
 apologies for the possible silly question (i don't think it is, but), 
 but is Eircom's aDSL service NAT'ed?
 
 and what implications would that have for VoIP? I know there are 
 difficulties with VoIP or connecting to clients connected to a NAT'ed 
 network from the internet wild (i.e. machines with static, real IPs)
 
 any help pointers would be helpful,

 And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually 
 quite funny .. if DMA was enabled for the CD-ROM *and* you tried to access 
 a CD with Joliet extensions. Otherwise it worked just fine with DMA 
 enabled :)

 There are several issues here.
 
 (1) For reasons that have nothing to do with
 commercial advertising, we need email software that
 prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez. We
 simply can't continue down the path where every
 script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can
 cause millions or billions of dollars worth of
 damage.
 
 (2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the
 point that digital signatures are the standard way
 to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging
 your machine or otherwise compromising your private
 key will be the only way that someone can forge a
 message from you. I don't see any reason that email
 software that automatically uses digital signatures
 for contact management and whitelisting would be
 any more expensive than existing email clients.
 Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
 on it.
 
 (3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
 with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
 nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
 parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George
 Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
 I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
 private key should should fall into that category.

 Or any of the Microsoft USB keyboards.  I've an MS Internet Pro unit with two
 ports off it's hub.
 
 I've considered using the 64mb flash unit in one of them as storage for keys.
 Unfortunately the KVM switching would drive the client programs crazy when
